Edvard Munch,The Scream,05.02.2012,"119,922,496","Acquired directly from the artist by the previous owner
At first glance, Edvard Munch would seem an unlikely inspiration for Andy Warhol. Born into poverty, Munch lost his mother to tuberculosis at the age of 5.  Subsequent up-rearing by a religiously fanatical and periodically violent father left him emotionally vulnerable. Later, despite commercial success, the artist battled severe depression by drowning himself in alcohol and nicotine and eventually entering a sanatorium in Copenhagen to treat his ‘nerve crisis.’ Ultimately, Munch died isolated and alone, bequeathing his entire estate to the municipality of Oslo.  
  However, despite their obvious biographical differences, Munch’s oeuvre was shaped by many of the same philosophical preoccupations which would later underpin Warhol.  Munch, like Warhol, was obsessed with visualizations of sex, sexuality and death, frequently drawing on these motivations

John Richardson
The Eye of the Storm: Warhol and Picasso

I arrived in New York for the first time in 1959 and within a year or two I met Andy. After that I saw a great deal of him. But nobody ever got to know Andy or, for that matter, Picasso: neither ever really opened up to anybody. Andy was often asking me about Picasso.

I see Andy always at the Eye of the Storm. The Eye of the Storm where there is stillness, and all around is disaster. Here was Andy at the center of all this horror: the horror of modern life. Yet Andy was unaffected. He felt this, he sensed this, but he wasn’t one of the victims of it. By virtue of being in the Eye of the Storm he could see it. And he transmitted his feelings into these amazing images.

When I gave the eulogy at Andy’s funeral I stressed the fact that Andy was a Catholic who went to Mass every single

One of the iconic images of the Blue and Rose periods, Garçon à la pipe probably began as a study from life in Picasso’s immediate surroundings but was dramatically transformed in a moment of sudden inspiration. According to André Salmon: “After a delightful series of metaphysical acrobats, dancers like priestesses of Diana, delightful clowns and ‘wistful Harlequins,’ Picasso had painted, without a model, the purest and simplest image of a young Parisian working boy, beardless and in blue overalls: having indeed, more or less the same appearance as the artist himself during working hours. One night, Picasso abandoned the company of his friends and their intellectual chit-chat. He returned to his studio, took the canvas he had abandoned a month before and crowned the figure of the little apprentice lad with roses. He had made this work a masterpiece thanks to a sublime whim” (André

An undisputed masterpiece of Giacometti's sculpture, L'Homme qui marche I is also one of the most iconic images of Modern art. It represents the pinnacle of Giacometti's experimentation with the human form, combining a monumental, imposing size with a rich rendering of the surface. Capturing a transient moment in the figure's movement, Giacometti created both a humble image of an ordinary man, and a potent symbol of humanity.
  The present work is the first of two versions of L'Homme qui marche, executed in 1960, at the highpoint of Giacometti's mature period. By this time, the image of a standing or walking human figure was established as pivotal to the artist's iconography. Between 1947 and 1950 Giacometti made several sculptures on the subject of the walking man, alone or in a small group positioned on a platform suggestive of a city square (fig. 3).

Giacometti's extraordinary Chariot is his masterpiece and ranks among the definitive achievements of 20th century art.  With its painted surface and rich, golden patina, the present sculpture is perhaps the most important bronze that the artist created. His biographer James Lord, while discussing what is considered Giacometti’s ""great period"" of the late 1940s and early 1950s, identified Chariot as his finest accomplishment: ""There are many extraordinary sculptures of 1949 and 1950,"" he wrote. ""Among them all, however, there is one, perhaps, more extraordinary than the others by reason of having required him to be extraordinary. It asks the beholder to be extraordinary, too"" (J. Lord, Giacometti, New York, 1985, p. 304).

Dora Maar au chat is one of Picasso’s most spectacular depictions of his mistress and artistic companion (see fig. 1).   Picasso's love affair with Maar (1907-1997) was a partnership of intellectual exchange and intense passion that lasted nearly a decade, and Maar’s influence on the artist resulted in some of his most daring portraits of his career.   Among the best of them are the oils completed during the war years, when Picasso's art resonated with the drama and emotional upheaval of the era.  The luminous Dora Maar au chat  was painted in 1941, at the beginning of the Second World War in France and just as the couple's relationship was reaching its fiery climax.   This large canvas is one of the most complete and compositionally dynamic depictions

Mark Rothko's Orange, Red, Yellow from 1956 is a radiantly beautiful and monumental masterpiece in the artist's oeuvre.   In this work the master abstract painter reduces colors to their essence while transforming them into form, space, and light.  As with many of his paintings from 1950-1956, the present work has a compelling sense of harmony as Rothko's stratified color achieves its highest level of success. Rothko's absolute authority over color, surface, texture and composition was never more commanding than in his paintings from the mid-1950s such as Orange, Red, Yellow. Experimentation in the balance of these elements, and the proportion of weight or suspension given to each field of color, created a majestic series of sensual, enigmatic masterpieces of gripping presence. Orange, Red, Yellow is amongst the most sensational of them

White Center dates from an annus mirabilis in Mark Rothko's long career-the crucial moment of 1950-when the artist finally established the signature style which continued, with many refinements, until his death in 1970. One of the largest canvases out of the sixteen Rothko painted during that key year, it was also among the most fully resolved (for example, the even bigger No.5 in the Museum of Modern Art, New York, still retains calligraphic markings which evoke an earlier phase). Certainly, White Center's dazzling amplitude and finesse invite an otherwise overused label-the appellation of masterpiece. In short, its commanding scale, sumptuousness and sheer intensity bespeak a modern master in the first full flush of his mature creativity. As such, White Center is also a

Nu assis sur un divan (La Belle Romaine) exemplifies Modigliani's conquest of the nude, a subject that is considered his greatest accomplishment in painting.  Continuing the tradition of Botticelli's Venus, Velazquez's Rokeby Venus, Ingres' Baigneuse turque and Manet's Olympia, it ranks among the definitive nudes in the history of Western art.  
Few pictures explore the pleasures of the flesh with such candor, intimacy and immediate appeal.   Modigliani believed that ""to paint a woman is to possess her.""    Indeed, her availability to engage with us is undeniable, with her rosy thigh projecting into the foreground.  The tilt of her head, piled with lustrous black hair, the strained exposure of the neck, the arch of her brow and

Mark Rothko is among the pantheon of artists whose ability to evoke universal truths through painting has fundamentally shifted our visual culture. Gifted by the artist to the Weisman family in a gesture of friendship and remaining in the family since then, Untitled (Nude) and Untitled (Underwater Series) embody two crucial stages in the artist’s creative growth, acting as pivotal exemplars in the development of Rothko’s voice in New York’s mid-century artistic firmament. Rothko met the late Jesse Weisman in the 1930s and the two became trusted friends, sharing summer rental houses in Mahopac, NY on their family vacations with their wives and children. As Jesse’s daughter, Susan Weisman McGee, recalls, “when my brother, Peter, was young and the Rothkos would come over to visit, Mark would sit Peter on his lap and draw pictures of cowboys and Indians.”

Teeming with visual drama and emotion, Van Gogh's richly-colored bouquet of wildflowers exemplifies the creative genius of the artist at the culmination of his career.  Depicting a bounty of sensory splendor from the fields of Auvers, this important picture captures the artist at the height of his mania and only weeks before his tragic end.  It was during this period that Van Gogh painted the most powerful pictures of his career, including his legendary Portrait of Dr. Paul Gachet and Wheat Fields with Crows.  An expressive masterwork, Nature morte, Vase aux marguerites et coquelicots transcends the boundaries of its genre and offers an insightful psychological profile.
The present composition was painted in mid-June 1890 in Auvers-sur Oise, the town where the artist settled following his release from the asylum at St-Rémy in May 1890.

The late 1940s witnessed the emergence of the New York school of Abstract Expressionism as a historic movement that both celebrated the groundbreaking schools of Modernism and forged a uniquely independent departure into new territories of artistic expression.  Jackson Pollock gained recognition as a modern master largely due to his revolutionary drip paintings.  Pollock had spent two years formulating and evolving the drip paintings in the Long Island barn that was his studio and by 1949 the breakthrough technique was perfected.  Number 26, 1949, in its perfect balance between figuration and abstraction, abandon and control, is an example of Pollock’s assured command of his innovative technique.
Prior to moving to Long Island in 1945, the most apocryphal moment in Pollock’s career was the creation of the mural painting commissioned by his dealer,

Claude Monet’s Nymphéas are amongst the most iconic and celebrated Impressionist paintings. The profound impact the series has made on the evolution of Modern Art marks them out as Monet’s greatest achievement. The famous lily pond in his garden at Giverny provided the subject matter for most of his major late works, recording the changes in his style and his constant pictorial innovations. The present work, which dates from 1906, is a powerful testament to Monet’s enduring vision and creativity in his mature years. Monet’s Nymphéas from 1905-1907 are triumphantly achieved monuments of colour; the water reflects the skies’ shifting hues and the lilies themselves are elegant touches of paint applied with bravura. As Daniel Wildenstein notes, all the works created in 1906 were painted from the same spot, and took an especially close up view of the pond, with a number of water

Francis Bacon, the acknowledged master of late 20th century portraiture, believed that abstract art devoid of human content lacked emotional resonance. Refusing to abandon figuration, he created a momentous oeuvre of isolated and tortured individuals who appear to be living at the extreme edge of existence. The most recognizable figures in Bacon's canon are his Papal portraits of which Study from Innocent X is a profoundly powerful example. Bacon was deeply affected by Diego Velázquez' Portrait of Pope Innocent X (1650) and it became his most famous arena for the rendering of flesh in all its tactile glory and psychological deconstruction. Engaging with the grand tradition of the Old Masters to produce an iconic visage for our times, Bacon reinvented the public image of the Pope - arguably the most powerful man of earlier centuries - to capture the intimate

Giacometti’s extraordinary Grande tête mince, also known as Grande tête de Diego, is a robust personification of the Existentialist movement during the heated years of the Cold War.  Of all his representations of the human figure, this sculpture is without question Giacometti's most formally radical, visually engaging and emotionally impactful.  This imposing figure, parting his lips as if he is about to speak, embodies the anticipation of a moment yet to be realized.   The model for this profoundly expressive sculpture was the artist's younger brother Diego, who inspired numerous variations on the theme of head and bust sculptures of the 1950s and whose physiognomic similiarity to his brother invested these projects with an autobiographical narrative.  The powerful Grande tête

In 1955, The Saturday Evening Post asked its readers to select their favorite cover painted by its most beloved artist, Norman Rockwell. By that year, the popularity of this American publication was enormous, due in large part to the highly original images Rockwell crafted for its cover on a regular basis. Between 1916 and 1963, Rockwell executed over 300 of these commissions, making him one of the most recognizable figures in American art for nearly three-fourths of a century. Despite the wide variety and large number of covers readers could choose from, the outcome of the survey proved decisive: 32 percent of the final vote went to Saying Grace, the quietly poignant image of a grandmother and her grandson praying over a meal in the diner of a train station. Painted in 1951, Saying Grace epitomizes Rockwell’s classic iconography

'Bullfighting is like boxing - a marvellous aperitif to sex'.  Francis Bacon1   

The drama and the choreographed violence of the corrida gripped Francis Bacon's imagination over a lengthy period. Just six paintings survive to testify to this enduring fascination (two of them do so only obliquely), and they all fall within the years 1967 to 1987. Simultaneously monumental and visceral, Second Version of Study for Bullfight No.1 (1969) is a compelling evocation of a ritual slaughter, a tussle between man and animal in a public spectacle which heightens the human comedy to a level of absurdity that Bacon surely relished.
Bacon only completed (or rather, refrained from disassembling) one triptych on a bullfighting theme, Triptych 1987 (Estate of Francis Bacon). While it was still in progress he was asked if the painting

George Dyer will live for ever in the iconography of the English face.""

John Russell, Francis Bacon, London 1993, pp. 160-65.

Within the grand theatre of Francis Bacon’s life and work, George Dyer inhabits a position of tremendous importance. Appearing in over forty paintings, with as many created following his death as executed during his lifetime, Dyer wields a power unlike any other. His portrayal spans the full extent of human drama: at once vulnerable, brooding, romantic, absurd, heroic and tortured Bacon’s

Modern Rome – Campo Vaccino is one of the greatest masterpieces by Britain's finest and most celebrated artist. With its extraordinary mastery of light and colour it looks forward to the experimental works of the last decade of the artist's life whilst also reflecting the inspiration which Turner derived from his great love of the Old Masters, notably Claude Lorraine. It marks the culmination of Turner's fascination with Italy, and particularly with Rome and his absorption of the strong light of Italy which underlies most of his great paintings of the last twenty years of his life. Turner felt a particular affinity with Rome with its potent contrast between the ancient city with the remains of its great imperial past and the modern city teeming with life and activity. This picture was his final depiction of that great city, the cradle of Western civilisation, and he

“These are the edgings and inchings of final form” – Wallace Stevens (Wallace Stevens, “An Ordinary Evening in New Haven,” in The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens, London, 1984, p. 488)
To encounter the majestic No. 21 is to be embraced by the full force of Mark Rothko’s evocation of the sublime. As privileged viewers of this indisputable, inimitable masterwork we are afforded a visual and somatic experience that is beyond compare and bespeaks the absolute mastery of the artist’s abstract vernacular. Executed in 1951 at the very incipit of what David Anfam, the editor of the artist’s catalogue raisonné, refers to as the anni mirabilis of Rothko’s oeuvre, the present work is a paragon of this halcyon era in which his mature mode of artistic expression pioneered truly unprecedented territory.

Femme assise près d’une fenêtre is a stunning and monumental image of Picasso’s ‘golden muse’, Marie-Thérèse Walter (fig. 3), and is among the most iconic images of his œuvre. Picasso's sensual paintings of his lover Marie-Thérèse reign supreme as the emblems of love, sex and desire in twentieth-century art. It was in a series of paintings executed in 1932 that the artist introduced the young woman as an extraordinary new presence in both his life and his art. The present work depicts the serene model seated in front of a window, and is one in a series of defining paintings of this period. Devoid of the attributes that often accompany her in other compositions, such as a book (fig. 1) or a mandolin (fig. 2), in the present work Marie-Thérèse’s imposing figure and striking facial features are the main focus of the composition.  His muse’s potent

Defining Beauty: Sleeping Girl

Held within a swirling frame of abundant blonde hair, the weary head of flawless beauty rests upon a red pillow. Invited into her bounded domain as if through a keyhole, our gaze rests upon her profound contemplation; immersed by such elusive thoughts as can only be encountered in sleep's deepest dreams. We scan her expression for some sign to her preoccupation, but her secrets remain locked within. While our focus falls on her immediately close presence, her focus strays far away. The assuredly iconic depiction of a strikingly intimate and vulnerable moment, Sleeping Girl is a masterpiece of irresistible seduction.

Black and white, yellow and red, the composition exists through sensational graphic efficiency and brilliant color of shocking confidence. The polarized schema of the hair is rendered in sublime cadence, dramatically accentuating

Throughout her career, Georgia O’Keeffe strove to depict what she described as “the wideness and wonder of the world as I live in it.” Her spirit of adventure and passion for the natural world drove her to explore the landscape of the United States, and to do so in such diverse places as Lake George, New York and Abiquiú, New Mexico. As such, the core of O’Keeffe’s work lies in the natural imagery around her, but her ability to capture the elusive boundary between representation and abstraction is central to her singular language of modernism.

Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1 is a strikingly bold and elegant representation of the artist’s mature intent and aesthetic. Painted in 1932, the work exhibits one of O’Keeffe’s most enduring motifs: her innovative renderings of magnified flowers. O’Keeffe first explored this theme early in her career, drawn to the flower as subject for

200 One Dollar Bills is the monumental masterpiece from Warhol's first series of silkscreened paintings and is a powerful declaration of the genesis of Warhol's major contribution to art history. Warhol had already revolutionized American art by restoring representation and objective imagery to painting in the startling guise of common, everyday objects such as Campbell's Soup Cans, comics, magazine advertisements and newspaper headlines in late 1961 to early 1962. But the `Pop Art' revolution was not complete until Warhol discovered the artistic technique that would give him the freedom to exploit his new approach to subject matter. Warhol responded to the post-war world's media and consumerist saturation by seeking a form of art that would remove the hand of the artist, creating the same sense of distance and disconnect that was emerging in the world around him. Earlier Warhol

This remarkable painting is a masterpiece by Francesco Guardi, impressive not only for its imposing dimensions but also for its extraordinary pictorial quality. In terms of its importance within the oeuvre of the painter, it ranks alongside three other works, all painted at around the same time, which together constitute the pinnacle of Guardi's output as a painter of vedute; one of these was, until recently, in the same ownership (fig. 1), one is now destroyed and the other is in a private collection.1
Guardi would never again paint on such a scale as this. Although he had previously painted two larger canvases (Waddesdon Manor), 2 they were executed several years earlier in the artist's most youthful style, and are lacking the moody exuberance, the impressionistic handling and virtuoso brushwork so evident here. The painting recalls the early vedute

Modigliani reveled in exposing the sensuality of his female sitters.  Among the most provocative of his works are his portraits of his lover Jeanne Hébuterne (1898-1920) (see fig. 1), who was his primary model and muse during the last years of his life (see fig. 2).  Jeanne was about 20 at the time the artist painted the present portrait in 1918 and two years into a romantic relationship with the artist that would last until his death in 1920.  The present portrait is one in a series that Modigliani completed in 1918, depicting Jeanne in profile.  The linearity of her form recalls the finely chiseled stone carvings that Modigliani had executed seven years earlier (see fig. 3).   Her elongated features, particularly the graceful curve of her slender neck, appealed to the Mannerist-inspired aesthetic that Modigliani had developed

Painted in 1889-90, Les Pommes encapsulates Cézanne’s artistic achievement, and displays the brilliance and economy which characterize his best work. This strikingly modern composition foregrounds the artist's unrivaled facility with the medium and his ability to imbue a still-life with all of the subtlety and emotional potency of portraiture.

Cézanne’s still-lifes have long been recognized among his greatest achievements, the works which demonstrate most clearly the innovations that led to the stylistic developments of early twentieth-century art.  His vision breathed new life into the tradition of still-life painting, and his accomplishments had a profound impact on the generations of artists that followed. Picasso proclaimed that “Cézanne was like the father of us all,” and this statement has remained true to this day, with his painting,

The extraordinary Nature morte aux tulipes  is one of the celebrated 'Marie-Thérèse pictures' that would ultimately establish Picasso as the most famous artist in the world. Painted in 1932, the year that is recognized as the pinnacle of Picasso's near-century long production, this magnificent painting evidences the creative explosion that defines the renderings of his incomparable golden muse, Marie-Thérèse Walter.   Nature morte aux tulipes  provides us with a synthesis of the two main media (painting and sculpture)  that Picasso utilized to represent the scale, dimensionality and physical impact of his young lover.  More than many of the pictures from this era, it evidences his desire to objectify his model in the truest sense of the word.  ""Picasso pursued, embellished, transformed, deconstructed,

Picasso's iconic paintings of his lover Marie-Thérèse Walter reign supreme as the emblems of love, sex and desire in twentieth-century art. The sensual La Lecture, which is one of the most recognisable images among this landmark series from the beginning of 1932, essentially introduced the young woman as an extraordinary new presence in Picasso's life and his art. This exceptional work is one in a series of defining paintings in the artist's œuvre in which he depicts his lover asleep in an armchair, the curves of her body transformed into a sumptuous confection with colourful swirls and sweeping arabesques. Marie-Thérèse's potent mix of physical attractiveness and sexual naivety had an intoxicating effect on Picasso, and his rapturous desire for the girl brought about a wealth

Klimt's dramatic view of the lush environs of Lake Attersee is among his most accomplished and celebrated landscapes.  The sumptuous palette and the jewel-like surface evidence Klimt's poetic opulence at its most magnificent and evoke the decorative tendency displayed in earlier landscapes. In Litzlberg am Attersee the scene rises like a vertical wall of natural splendor and man-made artifact.
Klimt and his model Emilie Flöge spent the summer months of 1914 in Weissenbach on the south shore of Attersee, where a relative of the Flöge sisters lived.  The couple returned there the following two summers, usually staying between July and mid-September. The sisters, their mother Barbara, and the young Helene Klimt moved into the house next door to their relative, while Klimt found lodgings in the forester's house on the outskirts at the entrance to the

Jackson Pollock interviewed by William Wright, Summer 1950, cited in Clifford Ross, ed., Abstract Expressionism: Creators and Critics, New York, 1990, p. 144

Worthy of the highest critical acclaim, yet readily surpassing the inadequacies of mere written description, Jackson Pollock’s Number 4, 1951 encapsulates on one canvas the pure essence of his art and is, quite simply, a resounding and incontrovertible masterpiece of Abstract Expressionism. The occasion of this painting’s appearance for sale is a spectacularly rare and historic event: in the past quarter century only an elite handful of drip paintings on canvas by Pollock have been offered at auction. Executed in 1951, this work epitomizes the chromatic variance, heroic drama and thrilling dynamism of the 1950 masterworks

Painted in 1914, Häuser mit bunter Wäsche (Vorstadt II) is one of Schiele's most impressive and important townscapes. Combining the river in the foreground and fields in the background with the colourful houses and drying laundry stretching along the middle of the composition, it unites the natural and the man-made in a harmonious and vivid composition. The geometry and linearity of brightly coloured houses and laundry lines create a shimmering, highly decorative effect that represented a legacy of Schiele's mentor Gustav Klimt. Set against a strongly delineated, neutrally coloured landscape, they create an atmospheric composition which is, as is the case with Schiele's most accomplished landscapes, reflective of the artist's state of mind. It is this combination of the decorative and the symbolic that makes Häuser mit bunter Wäsche (Vorstadt II) one of the finest paintings

This extraordinarily compact, block-like sculpture was conceived in Paris in the winter of 1906-07 and is one of Picasso’s most important early bronzes. The group of works made between the autumn of 1906 and 1909 posed new questions hitherto unknown in European sculpture, putting them on a par with Picasso’s work as a painter and draftsman. Reduced to the essentials, the schematic treatment of the almond-shaped eyes, the smooth surface and the symmetrical features of this piece create the impression of perfect serenity.

“This mask-like object is the sculptural consequence of a radical transition in Picasso’s pictorial and graphic work from a portrait-like conception of the head to a form of expressive stylization” writes Werner Spies. “For the first time, Picasso obtains a sculptural representation in which dependence on received patterns and an interest in autonomous, compositionally

The Mirror and the Nude - Composing a Masterpiece
  Widely regarded by historians and critics alike as one of the most important works in Francis Bacon's oeuvre, Study of Nude With Figure in a Mirror is exceptionally rare both as a full-length depiction of a female nude and because of the enigmatic two-figure narrative that it incorporates into a single panel, the usual reserve of his triptych formats. Requested for all the major exhibitions of his work since its creation in 1969 such as the 1971 Grand Palais retrospective in Paris and the 1985 Tate Gallery retrospective, it condenses into a singular image the entire scope of Bacon's vision. In his celebrated monograph, the renowned art historian John Russell concludes that with Study of Nude With Figure in a Mirror ""We are left wondering if natural life - life

Gauguin's lush images of Tahitian women amidst the splendor of the tropics are a wealth of sensual beauty.   This gorgeous canvas was painted on the island's southern coastal region of Mataiea in September or October 1892, about a year into the artist's first extended stay in French Polynesia.  The title of the painting, Te poipoi, refers to the morning ablutions of the young woman in the foreground.  We can imagine Gauguin's voyeuristic pleasure in watching this intimate moment beneath a canopy of banyan and mango trees.  Painting this scene must have been irresistible to him.  During his first trip to Tahiti Gauguin devoted a number of compositions, in oil (see figs. 1 & 2) and in woodcut (Guerin no. 41), to depicting the local women at their tropical toilette.  In 1893 he even made this a vignette in his illustrated

Léger's heroic Femme en bleu is one of the grandes dames of Cubism.  This spectacular image is one the movement's most enduring achievements and a milestone on the path to abstraction.  Created on the eve of the First World War, it captures the watershed moment when Léger pushed beyond figuration, a radical gesture which would find full expression in his celebrated Contrastes de formes of 1913.
Léger's obsession with this image gave way to three major interpretations, all completed within months of each other, that stress various points in the artist's development.  The first of these works was an oil 'study' from 1912, the same size as the present picture, that Léger kept in his private collection until his death, when it was given to the Musée National Fernand Léger in Biot (see fig. 1).  The second, which is the largest, or

“These frozen images are modern-day Madonnas. Andy was a strict Catholic. His Marilyn, Liz and Jackie become religious relics, and like Leonardo’s La Gioconda, they are portraits of women radiating beauty. They are not photographs of public stars but…icons of our time. They are, in essence, holy.” (Peter Brant in Exhibition Catalogue, New York, C&M Arts, Women of Warhol, Marilyn, Liz & Jackie, 2000, p. 3)
  It is a testament to the visual power and philosophical foresight of Andy Warhol’s art that in the new century his images of one of the twentieth century’s most prominent icons, Marilyn Monroe, are probably more famous than the icon herself. To an entire generation born after her cinematic beauty and glow lit up the screens, it is Warhol’s glowing memorials to her celebrity which are etched onto the collective international conscience.

Degas' studies of ballet dancers in various stages of preparation and performance is one of the most iconic genres of Impressionist art. In addition to being a comprehensive exploration of an activity that challenged the possibilities of physical movement and artistry of the human body, these studies, primarily done with pastel, are also a window into Parisian society at the end of the nineteenth century and a deeply psychological examination of performers who entertained the social elite. In the present work, Degas focuses his attention on one dancer, who is diligently stretching backstage prior to a performance. Engaged in her craft, she looks away from the viewer. Her body, graceful and lithe, is rendered with refined sensitivity, the curves of her body and the form of her limbs taking shape through Degas' adroit manipulation of color and line in the pastel medium.

‘Insofar as possible I’d like to get beyond easel painting, which in my opinion pursues a petty aim’, Miró declared in 1938, a decade after he famously proclaimed that he wanted to ‘assassinate painting’. For the rest of his career he produced works that embody a paradox unique to his œuvre: whilst creating art that went against traditional notions of painting, he never ceased to be a painter and to see himself primarily as a painter. Later in life Miró explained: ‘Anti-painting was a revolt against a state of mind and traditional painting techniques that were later judged morally unjustifiable. It was also an attempt to express myself through new materials’ (quoted in Joan Miró: Painting and Anti-Painting, 1927-1937 (exhibition catalogue), The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2008-09, p. 1).

“Say, the painting of a flag is always about a flag, but it is no more about a flag than it is about a brush-stroke or about a color or about the physicality of the paint, I think.” Jasper Johns in an unpublished interview with David Sylvester recorded for the BBC at Edisto Beach, South Carolina, Spring 1965, published in Exh. Cat., Oxford, Museum of Modern Art (and travelling), Jasper Johns Drawings, 1974, p. 13
One of the most influential paintings of the last century came to Jasper Johns in a dream. Johns dreamt one night of painting a large American flag and, as the legend goes, the next morning he subsequently set out to do so. Executed almost three decades later, Flag of 1983 unarguably represents the most mature and profoundly personal realization of Johns’ iconic subject. With every sumptuous inflection of paint, Flag reveals a hushed accumulation of

The occasion was the opening of the Aswan Dam on December 10, 1902; Alma-Tadema was the guest of Sir John Aird (1833-1911), the reknowned engineer who had been awarded its building contract. Taking four years to complete, the dam was then the world's most ambitious masonry construction project to date and only one of Aird's many accomplishments both professional (from the re-erection of London's Crystal Palace buildings) to political (Aird served as a Conservative Member of Parliament and was made a baronet in 1901). Aird's successes afforded him a fine home in Hyde Park Terrace and the resources to acquire paintings by the most important artists of the time. Often called ""St. John Aird of the Large Heart,"" he was known for his close, supportive relationships with the artists

Le Grand Canal is an exceptionally rare and beautiful painting from the esteemed series of works that Monet painted in Venice in 1908. The ineffable light conditions of the city are in this work rendered as dappling crests of pink and gold upon the surface of the canal and imbue the domes of Santa Maria della Salute with a pearlescent glow. This view of the Grand Canal is arguably the most iconic of all the Venetian paintings. Monet executed six canvases which show variations on the theme of Santa Maria della Salute seen from the steps of the Palazzo Barbaro (figs. 1 & 2), where he set up his easel during the first half of October. Joachim Pissarro describes this group of works as, ‘unquestionably one of Monet’s most systematic series. The six canvases are almost exactly the same dimensions; the layout of the motif is virtually identical in all, and each of the canvases was painted

As the original study for Coca-Cola [4] (lot 12), 1962, the present work is the extant chronicle of the genesis of American Pop Art. It is both an exquisite drawing and historic artefact that records the poised moment when Pop fully evolved and started fundamentally to affect an entire generation. If Andy Warhol is considered the progenitor of American Pop, Coca-Cola [4] can be seen as the seed of the movement that revolutionised contemporary art practice. Executed in 1962, the present drawing shows the artist's first experiments with the ideas that would occupy him for the rest of his career. It is one of the earliest recorded drawings in the catalogue raisonné, identified by Georg Frei and Neil Printz as the preparatory study for the Coca-Cola painting executed between May and June 1962 and over two metres tall (Georg Frei and Neil Printz, Eds., The Andy Catalogue

Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.
Basquiat’s burgeoning stardom reached a climax in 1982, the year after Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) was created. The artist spent 1982 jet-setting around the world, appearing at major exhibitions, as each

Monet's magnificent depiction of his garden at Vétheuil exemplifies the visual splendor of Impressionism at its height.  Monet painted this work in 1881 as a new chapter of his life was unfolding, and this picture expresses the exuberance and renewed passion of the artist during this important period.  Seated among the flowers is Alice Hoschedé, the artist's thirty-seven year old lover and the wife of his close friend and patron Ernst Hoschedé.  The composition is lavished with all of the hallmarks of a great Impressionist composition, with its vivid color palette, intermingling of the

A master portraitist and key figure in French intellectual circles in the late nineteenth century, Manet executed a number of outstanding portraits of his contemporaries: his fellow artists Claude Monet, Eva Gonzalès and Berthe Morisot, writers Emile Zola and Stéphane Mallarmé, politicians Georges Clemenceau, Antonin Proust and Henri de Rochefort, art collectors and patrons Jean-Baptiste Faure and Ernest Hoschedé, author and critic Théodore Duret, his wife Suzanne Manet and many others. However, Manet only painted two self-portraits, both executed around the same time: the present work, and Portrait de Manet par lui-même (Manet à la calotte), now in the Bridgestone Museum of Art, Tokyo (fig. 1).

This painting, which has been inaccessable to scholars since 1940, is the most significant Canaletto rediscovery for more than a decade and has a particularly distinguished provenance, only recently identified.
The view is taken from the Palazzo Foscari on the sharp bend in the Grand Canal, known as the Volta de Canal, roughly equidistant from its entrance onto the Bacino di San Marco and the Rialto Bridge. Looking North-East from there the whole of the longest straight stretch of the canal is visible, as far as the Rialto Bridge, part of which is shown in the far distance, with the roof and dome of the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo beyond. Apart from being a particularly well balanced composition, and one in which water occupies the full breadth of the canvas, the view has the relatively unusual distinction of being observable, even from some height above the water,

Le Boulevard Montmartre, matinée de printemps comes from the collection of Max Silberberg (1878-1942), an industrialist based in Breslau and the owner of one of the finest pre-war collections of 19th and 20th Century art in Germany. Alongside magnificent examples of classic French Impressionism by Manet, Monet, Renoir and Sisley, Silberberg also collected masterpieces of Realism and Post-Impressionism including several works by Delacroix and Courbet together with paintings by Cézanne and van Gogh. A prominent member of the business community and a generous patron of Jewish causes, by 1935 Silberberg was forced to relinquish his public roles, his company was Aryanised and sold, and his house was occupied by the SS. The collector was forced by the Nazi authorities to consign most of his wonderful collection, including the present work, to a series

Shortly after his fiftieth birthday, Pablo Picasso’s lover at the time, Marie-Thérèse Walter, nearly drowned while kayaking on the river Marne, and this distressing accident served as a source of inspiration for the present work. Executed in the fall of 1932, Le Sauvetage belongs to a series of drawings and paintings that illustrate the episode, but the artist took considerable liberties in its retelling. The drawing gives central focus to a dramatic image of a drowned woman being rescued, her figure embellished by an erotic sensuousness, and Picasso heightens the fear and crisis of the scene through the tension of the energetic yet restrained sketching.
In his most recent biography on the artist, John Richardson discusses Picasso's approach to these compositions and how they were colored by his own fears and desires: “He transposes the accident from the icy, rat-infested

Ridgefield, The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Mysterious and Magical Realism, April - August 1980, cat. no. 54
Mark Rothko is among the pantheon of artists whose ability to evoke universal truths through painting has fundamentally shifted our visual culture. Gifted by the artist to the Weisman family in a gesture of friendship and remaining in the family since then, Untitled (Nude) and Untitled (Underwater Series) embody two crucial stages in the artist’s creative growth, acting as pivotal exemplars in the development of Rothko’s voice in New York’s mid-century artistic firmament. Rothko met the late Jesse Weisman in the 1930s and the two became trusted friends, sharing summer rental houses in Mahopac, NY on their family vacations with their wives and children. As Jesse’s daughter, Susan Weisman McGee, recalls, “when my brother, Peter, was young and the Rothkos would come over to visit, Mark would sit Peter on his lap and draw pictures of cowboys and Indians.”

Modigliani reveled in exposing the sensuality of his female sitters.  Among the most provocative of his works are his portraits of his lover Jeanne Hébuterne (1898-1920) (see fig. 1), who was his primary model and muse during the last years of his life (see fig. 2).  Jeanne was about 20 at the time the artist painted the present portrait in 1918 and two years into a romantic relationship with the artist that would last until his death in 1920.  The present portrait is one in a series that Modigliani completed in 1918, depicting Jeanne in profile.  The linearity of her form recalls the finely chiseled stone carvings that Modigliani had executed seven years earlier (see fig. 3).   Her elongated features, particularly the graceful curve of her slender neck, appealed to the Mannerist-inspired aesthetic that Modigliani had developed

Rendered in the vibrant red and gold colors of the Spanish flag, Picasso’s glorious Mousquetaire à la pipe is a sensational example of a theme that defined the last years of his life. The iconography of the musketeer was indicative of Picasso's self-awareness in the years before his death. Gone from his paintings were the veiled references to the artist as the victorious gladiator or centaur, as these characters did not reflect the artist's failing stamina and lost youth. The vainglorious musketeer was believed to be a more appropriate incarnation, offering a spectrum of interpretations that occupied the artist until the end of his life.  
Picasso's work on this theme began in the mid-1960s with a series of engravings and works on paper that explored this figure, and, later, a variety of canvases of the musketeer, festooned in colorful

Alongside van Gogh, Munch was the key pioneer of Expressionism whose influence on the course of modern art cannot be overstated.  Both artists used the genre of landscape as a vehicle to express inner states of being.  In depicting nature in a highly individual, internalized manner, Munch draws on the tradition of stemningsmaleri, or 'mood-painting', characteristic of Nordic art towards the end of the nineteenth century. Alongside several fellow avant-garde artists, Munch abandoned the plein-air naturalism which had dominated Norwegian landscape painting, in favor of an emotionally charged and resonant vision of nature.  In the present masterpiece, he took as a starting point a scene he would have witnessed in Åsgårdstrand (fig. 6), similiar to the location in Oslo at Nordstrand where he painted his legendary composition,

Monet and his wife Alice travelled to Venice for the first time in the autumn of 1908 at the invitation of Mary Young Hunter, a wealthy American who had been introduced to the Monets by John Singer Sargent. They arrived on 1st October and spent two weeks as her guest at the Palazzo Barbaro, which belonged to a relation of Sargent - Mrs Daniel Sargent Curtis, before moving to the Grand Hotel Britannia on the Grand Canal where they stayed until their departure on 7th December. From the balcony of the Palazzo Barbaro, they could see three of the great palaces Monet was to paint during his time in Venice: Palazzo da Mula, Palazzo Dario and the subject of this painting, the Palazzo Contarini (fig. 1). Initially reluctant to leave his house and garden at Giverny, Monet must have sensed that the architectural splendours of Venice in their watery environment would present new and formidable challenges.

A powerful, dynamic and colourful depiction of a figure in motion, Danseuse is a quintessential Futurist composition. Severini painted his first dancers in 1911 and continued to be preoccupied with this subject over the next five years (figs. 1 & 2). Dating from the end of his Futurist period, Danseuse presents a culmination of the artist's exploration of this theme, which has come to be regarded as the icon of Futurism.
  Central to the Futurists' aesthetic was the idea of movement and speed, and in Danseuse Severini translates these notions onto canvas through the figure of the dancer, dissolving it into a vortex of linear trajectories and brilliant colour. As the second Futurist Manifesto of 1910 proclaimed: 'Gesture, for us, will no longer be a single moment within the universal dynamism brought to a sudden stop: it will be outright dynamic

Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.
Basquiat’s burgeoning stardom reached a climax in 1982, the year after Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) was created. The artist spent 1982 jet-setting around the world, appearing at major exhibitions, as each

 Alma-Tadema's The Meeting of Antony and Cleopatra: 41 BC, depicts one of the most iconic moments in Roman-Egyptian history, and the artist turned to Shakespeare – not translated ancient texts -- for inspiration. Between 1850 and 1912, the Bard's Antony and Cleopatra was regularly staged at London's theatres, and the Egyptian queen was fully entrenched in the public's mind --particularly for her intoxicating beauty and the power and tragic romance it attracted (Barrow, p. 116). In the present work, Alma-Tadema favors a quiet, nuanced moment in Shakespeare's drama: a strong memory recalled after the legendary lovers have been separated (Act II, scene ii, Swanson, Catalogue Raisonné, p. 219). Upon Caesar's assassination, Antony became one of the triumvirs ruling the Roman Empire, and summoned Cleopatra (who had been Caesar's lover) to Tarsus in Cilicia

This extraordinarily compact, block-like sculpture was conceived in Paris in the winter of 1906-07 and is one of Picasso’s most important early bronzes. The group of works made between the autumn of 1906 and 1909 posed new questions hitherto unknown in European sculpture, putting them on a par with Picasso’s work as a painter and draftsman. Reduced to the essentials, the schematic treatment of the almond-shaped eyes, the smooth surface and the symmetrical features of this piece create the impression of perfect serenity.

“This mask-like object is the sculptural consequence of a radical transition in Picasso’s pictorial and graphic work from a portrait-like conception of the head to a form of expressive stylization” writes Werner Spies. “For the first time, Picasso obtains a sculptural representation in which dependence on received patterns and an interest in autonomous, compositionally

Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.
Basquiat’s burgeoning stardom reached a climax in 1982, the year after Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) was created. The artist spent 1982 jet-setting around the world, appearing at major exhibitions, as each

A joyous bouquet of wildflowers dominates this glorious picture, which Matisse completed on the first Bastille Day following the Armistice ending World War I.   By his own account, the painting is a symbol of the artist's unrestraint exuberance on that momentous day in 1919, when all of France celebrated its national holiday amidst the newly restored peace.   When he presented this work to his dealer Bernheim-Jeune not long after it was completed, Matisse simply titled the work Le 14 juillet 1919, as the significance of that day spoke volumes about the meaning of his picture.  From an artistic standpoint, the painting heralds the fresh and colorful style that would define Matisse's career thenceforward, and signals the artist's renewed sense of optimism following

When discussing his own work, Bacon spontaneously turned to his portraits, as if these paintings came closest to epitomizing his creative ambition. Capturing so concisely his distinctive lick of hair and moonlike face, Three Studies for Self- Portrait belies a masochistic pleasure and fascination with tracing his own features, and corroborates Bacon’s view that, “one always has a greater involvement with oneself than with anybody else.” (Bacon quoted in Milan Kundera and France Borel, Bacon: Portraits and Self-Portraits, London, 1996, p. 241)
Throughout his career, Bacon returned to the portrait format steadfast in his belief that abstraction was merely aesthetic, and that art devoid of human content lacked emotional resonance. Along with the meticulously scrutinised faces of a handful of close friends, lovers and acquaintances during the 1970s, it was Bacon’s own

Painted at Saint-Rémy in October 1889, Van Gogh’s haunting depiction of a young mother, pining for her husband away at sea, is a brilliant example of the artist’s transformative vision of a time-honoured subject. Van Gogh arrived at the asylum in Saint-Rémy in May 1889, and during the following months produced some of his most celebrated masterpieces, including The Starry Night. His work of this period is notable for the bright, shimmering palette, and the present work displays his favourite tonal contrasts used in a number of other works executed around this time (fig. 1). In L’Homme est en mer the warm yellow and ochre hues of the fire and its warm glow against the fireplace and the floor provide a dynamic contrast to the cooler blue tones of the woman’s dress and the wall behind her. The radiance of the fire is beautifully reflected on the faces of the mother and her

Mark Rothko is among the pantheon of artists whose ability to evoke universal truths through painting has fundamentally shifted our visual culture. Gifted by the artist to the Weisman family in a gesture of friendship and remaining in the family since then, Untitled (Nude) and Untitled (Underwater Series) embody two crucial stages in the artist’s creative growth, acting as pivotal exemplars in the development of Rothko’s voice in New York’s mid-century artistic firmament. Rothko met the late Jesse Weisman in the 1930s and the two became trusted friends, sharing summer rental houses in Mahopac, NY on their family vacations with their wives and children. As Jesse’s daughter, Susan Weisman McGee, recalls, “when my brother, Peter, was young and the Rothkos would come over to visit, Mark would sit Peter on his lap and draw pictures of cowboys and Indians.”

Concern with the psychology and environment of travelers led Edward Hopper (1882-1967) to create some of his most compelling pictures, including views of train stations, highways, gas stations, restaurants, and hotels. The human need to seek shelter and sustenance while away from the security of one’s home offered dramatic settings where Hopper could convey a wealth of emotions. Hopper’s earlier versions of the hotel as theme include: Hotel Room (1931, El Museo de arte Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid), Hotel Lobby (1943, Indianapolis Museum of Art, figure 1), Hotel by a Railroad (1952, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C., figure 2). Western Motel (1957, Yale University Art Gallery, figure 3), which followed Hotel Window (1955), presents a view out of the window of a Californian landscape and Hopper’s automobile.

For Degas, the classrooms of the Paris Opéra Garnier functioned as his studio and mainstage for his depictions of the ballet. His practice ran parallel with the ballerinas’ rehearsals: as they laced their slippers, he sharpened his pencils; when they would dance, Degas would draw. He practiced and followed their movements with the very same precision and diligence with which the ballerinas executed their pliés and rond de jambes at the barre.
Danseuses à la barre is also emblematic of Degas’ continued interest in the Opéra’s stage and its spacious classrooms. In his drawing, Degas slants the floor plane on a diagonal and crops the ballerina by the frame while her limbs and gestures remain comfortably contained with the picture, absorbed in her craft. Without narrative, the viewer's focus is drawn directly to the dancers' movements and gestures. We thus find

Les Courses au Bois de Boulogne is one of Manet's most beautiful and striking images.  The deep aquamarine color of the grass track and the infield against which we see the horses and spectators is a bold and appealing pictorial conceit.  Moreover, it signals the artist's emphasis on the abstract characteristics of the composition as a whole.  Manet's slightly elevated vantage point causes the ground plane to seem to tilt toward the picture plane. The result is a strong emphasis on the rich and varied character of the surface of the painting.  The viewer's eye is drawn to the inherent beauty of the paint itself, whether in the broad expanse of the variegated aquamarine field that occupies the lower half of the canvas, or in such details as the jockeys' uniforms, the sheen of the horses' coats, the umbrellas in the lower right foreground, and the

L'Amazone is an early masterpiece which counts among Modigliani’s most famous images. While his subject is presented as an elegant horsewoman, her arched brow, pursed lips and smoldering gaze create a powerful erotic charge. The sharp angles and smooth curves of her upper body fill the canvas, as the sitter’s breasts and buttocks swell beneath her tightly-fitting riding coat. A femme fatale to rival his most revealing nudes, L'Amazone reveals Modigliani’s deeply passionate artistic vision.

The subject of this painting is Baroness Marguerite de Hasse de Villers, a glamorous socialite and the lover of Paul Alexandre’s younger brother Jean, who commissioned this portrait of his girlfriend in 1909.  Marguerite poses in her riding habit, with her gloved hand on hip and her sly glance at the artist transgressing the boundary of

Composition with Red, Blue and Grey is a highly important painting from a seminal period in Mondrian’s career, during which he laid down the pioneering strictures of Neo-Plasticism. Painted in 1927, it is a superb example of the artist's unique style that evolved through his resolute pursuit of a purified aesthetic vision. His project, to liberate painting from the domination of sensory perception and articulate universal principles that would give a new spiritual dimension to art, would become a template for both the aesthetic and the ideals of Modernism.
Mondrian’s return from the Netherlands to his studio in Paris in 1919 marked the beginning of a period of intense activity devoted to developing the style that would dominate his work of the 1920s. The return to an urban environment was a crucial influence, as the artist himself commented: ‘In the

Nature morte au melon vert is an outstanding example of Cézanne’s still-lifes, demonstrating the extraordinary freedom and audacity of style, and the confidence and assured quality of the artist’s technique that characterised his late years. The genre of still-life preoccupied Cézanne since the earliest days of his career, and the stylistic changes visible in his still-lifes reflect the overall development of his art. During the first decade of his artistic production, he executed a number of still-lifes, romantic in feeling, but based on his close observation of reality (see fig. 1). In the next two decades, his pictorial language became more sophisticated and his compositions more complex (see fig. 2). In the 1890s his still-lifes achieved their peak with a number of paintings and watercolours depicting various objects, usually fruit, jugs and baskets, placed on a table top (see

""De Kooning's recent paintings at the Fourcade Gallery absolutely required sustained attention. There could be no quick perception, no general impression that could cover the wealth of experience reflected… While de Kooning has for a long time managed to combine the near and the far in synopsis, in these new paintings the articulation is emphatic. He establishes his distance – both from his particular moment in time and from any general audience – and he maintains the singularity of intimate detail. In short, he offers a distinct, a unique realm in which imagination prevails.”
Dore Ashton, “75/76 New York,” Colóquio: Artes, no. 29, October, p. 14

Exceeding the confines of a vast canvas through its spectacular assault of unrestrained expression, Untitled V of 1975 encapsulates the full force of Willem de Kooning’s abstract vernacular. Through each visceral swathe,

Franz Marc's Weidende Pferde III was painted in Sindelsdorf in the Bavarian countryside, where Marc moved from Munich in the spring of 1910. The most significant productions of his œuvre are his compositions of horses, grazing alone or galloping together in rhythmically executed landscapes. Marc believed that the horse, with its flowing mane and strong, sinuous physicality, symbolised the ideal beauty of nature. In 1911, Marc and Wassily Kandinsky chose this majestic animal for part of the emblem of Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), the avant-garde movement that they founded in Munich. Weidende Pferde III, painted in 1910, is a magnificent painting that already exemplifies the objectives of this new wave of German Expressionism. The rhythmic dynamic postures of the four horses and vibrant colours of the composition evoke the sensation

Painted in 1905, Arbres à Collioure represents the pinnacle of Derain's career as well as of the Fauve movement. Its vibrant palette and wildly expressive composition place it among the artist's greatest achievements. Indeed, it is the unique painterly quality of the work which reflects precisely the power and immediacy of the artist's technique; every brushstroke is invigorated by the spirit of that most revolutionary summer of his career, spent with Henri Matisse in Collioure (fig. 1). Matisse had invited Derain to the small coastal town in early July 1905 and they spent the following two months working in close proximity, often painting the same subject (figs. 2 & 3). The sun-drenched atmosphere so typical of southern France had a profound effect on Derain and, shortly after his arrival, he wrote to Maurice de Vlaminck celebrating the light: 'a blond light, a golden

A joyous assembly of pattern and colour, Matisse’s Odalisque au fauteuil noir was painted in Nice at the beginning of 1942. The reappearance of the artist’s favourite subject - the odalisque - marked his return to health and artistic productivity. The composition is a vision of luxurious comfort, enhanced by the use of arabesques and generously proportioned black lines which underscore the vigorous application of colour. At the time he painted the present work, Matisse was living in Nice with his model and muse Lydia Delectorskaya. The artist had moved into the Hôtel Régina in Nice in October 1939, returning to the grand rooms which had become both his home and studio in the south of France. 
The outbreak of war in 1939 had compounded the already mounting problems in Matisse’s life. His marriage to Amélie was finally at an end after years of estrangement, and the presence

In a letter to American architect and art collector Philip Johnson dated October 12, 1959, Klein described his ritualistic instructions for selling 'Zones of Pictorial Immaterial Sensibility' which subverted capitalist trading strategies.  With help from the dealer Iris Clert, Klein noted that he: ""had made 'receipts,' which look like bank checks. The Zones are sold for a certain amount of gold. Seven numbered series exists, each of which contains ten more zones, also numbered. For every zone sold, a unique receipt is issued, which notes the amount of pure gold that represents the material value of the immaterial thing acquired by the buyer.'' (Ingrid Pfeiffer and Carla Orthen, 'Biography,' Yves Klein, ed. Olivier Berggruen, Milan, 2004, p. 221) Klein's receipts confirm the existence of an invisible conceptual work of art, the intent to prove that a formal sale of the

In a 1927 interview with the art critic Tériade, Miró declared that he wanted to ""assassinate painting"". This ""anti-painting"" crisis was reflected from 1930 onwards in his experimentation with new techniques and materials in his art. As a result, 1931 was the year of superimposed materials, collages and ""object-paintings"". The collage technique, in particular, represents a significant part of the artist's work. Miró did not think of collage in the Cubist manner; rather, he decided to apply it to new media, creating original associations, for example, by combining paper and wood with a metal or aluminium stand.
As Margit Rowell has pointed out, pieces from this period constituted a major revolution in Miró's body of work, and the collages he made at that time would go on to serve as a source of inspiration for the paintings created several years later, forming the alphabet of a prototype

Painted in 1915, at the height of Feininger’s Expressionist period, Jesuiten III is characteristic of the style that set him apart from his contemporaries.  The composition, with its linear rhythm and fragmented figures, also bears witness to the strong influence of Cubism.  Indeed, in May 1911, Feininger spent two weeks in Paris where he saw the Cubist works of Picasso and Braque.  Learning from their example and from that of his fellow German expressionist colleagues such as Kirchner, Feininger developed a style that enabled him to ‘build’ a picture piece by piece using a brilliant color palette.
Feininger’s experience as a graphic artist gave him a creative advantage when it came to rendering dimension in his painting (see fig. 1).  He was extraordinarily capable of conveying spatial depth without being reliant upon gradations of

“All along I wanted to find an artistic voice that belonged solely to me, without being affected by any great masters.”

Zeng Fanzhi is an artist whose renown is unparalleled in the world of Chinese contemporary art. Beginning with an artistic career in 1991 with Western mediums, Zeng Fanzhi’s journey has stretched past two decades; transitioning from his earlier role as a young novice studying Western Expressionism, to culminating in quintessentially Chinese renderings. He has exhibited extensively abroad, including at a solo exhibition at London’s Gagosian Gallery at the end of last year, and is looking forward to a large-scale retrospective show at Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris at the end of this year, all of which are indications to his status as an artist whose heritage, while expressed

Painted in 1967, L'Aubade exemplifies the dynamic force of Picasso's late work on a magnificent scale. Picasso presents a panegyric to the power of music framed within the central dialogue between artist and model. The male figure, a recognizable amalgamation of self-portrait and mosquetero, serenades a reclining female nude who recalls the recumbent beauties of Rubens and Ingres. With its foundations in this trajectory of art history, L'Aubade is a towering accomplishment and a dynamic depiction of an historic theme.
In June of 1967, Picasso painted three monumental works focused on the dialogue between the flautist and nude. On June 16th, he depicted his subjects in a horizontal plane with a clear delineation between figures, while two days later he completed the same subject in a vertical format. When he completed the present work, on June 20th,

""We nearly always live through screens – a screened existence. And I sometimes think, when people say my work looks violent, that perhaps I have from time to time been able to clear away one or two of the veils or screens""
The artist cited in: David Sylvester, Interviews with Francis Bacon, London 1993, p. 26

Capturing in paint an exceptional convergence of the artist's passions and talents, Figure Turning could not be more representative of Francis Bacon's phenomenal painting of the early 1960s, which was critical to both his breathtaking career and immense contribution to modern and contemporary art. From the especially decisive year of 1962, which witnessed the first major international retrospective of his work, this painting both summates the period of experimental investigation that preceded it as well as presciently anticipating several stylistic strategies

A triptych arrangement of poignant self-images in the red, white and blue of the American flag, there could not be a more apt eulogy to the most important artist of the second half of the last century, the art-world revolutionary who did more than any other to find a visual lexicon capable of documenting the changing landscape of post-war America. Like Jasper Johns' Flag, which marked the transition from Abstract Expressionism to a new aesthetic era, this suite of self-portraits is a marker of Pop, the high cultural moment of the latter half of the Twentieth Century. For three decades, Warhol's work charted the rise of America from post-war conservative repression to capitalist superpower, in turn philosophically pre-empting and predicting the celebrity and brand obsessed society in which the world lives today. In his obituary published in the Guardian the day after he died, the

Mark Rothko is among the pantheon of artists whose ability to evoke universal truths through painting has fundamentally shifted our visual culture. Gifted by the artist to the Weisman family in a gesture of friendship and remaining in the family since then, Untitled (Nude) and Untitled (Underwater Series) embody two crucial stages in the artist’s creative growth, acting as pivotal exemplars in the development of Rothko’s voice in New York’s mid-century artistic firmament. Rothko met the late Jesse Weisman in the 1930s and the two became trusted friends, sharing summer rental houses in Mahopac, NY on their family vacations with their wives and children. As Jesse’s daughter, Susan Weisman McGee, recalls, “when my brother, Peter, was young and the Rothkos would come over to visit, Mark would sit Peter on his lap and draw pictures of cowboys and Indians.”

Executed at the height of Monet’s Impressionism, Les Peupliers exemplifies the artist’s life-long commitment to painting en plein air, exploring the effects of weather conditions and light at different times of the day on the surrounding landscape. Painted in the plain of Les Essarts, this work depicts the green expanses not far from the artist’s home in Giverny, showing a row of colourful poplar trees in full blossom with the hills of Port-Villez visible in the background. Poplar trees appear in Monet’s art as early as 1858, rising elegantly in the background of Vue prise à Rouelles (G. Wildenstein, op. cit., no. 1), one of his earliest recorded paintings. Fascinated by their graceful appearance, Monet painted a number of views of poplar trees throughout the 1870s and 1880, moving this subject to the centre of his compositions, and emphasising their height

 Etude pour 'Portrait au manteau bleu' is a prime example of Matisse’s employment of charcoal and estompe, or the method of erasing to create highlights. The technique enabled him to create supremely rich and luminous effects in the over-all composition, exploiting the range of tonality between the deep black charcoal and the white of the sheet.  John Elderfield has written the following about Matisse's success with this method of application and erasure: ""Time and again Matisse would say the drawings should generate light…this was why charcoal and estompe – as well as lithography, which Matisse took up again in 1922 after eight years absence from it – were especially attractive to him.  Both media were particularly suited to an investigation of how tonal modeling could be reconciled with his longstanding concern for the decorative

Cy Twombly’s historic suite of twenty-four drawings, Poems to the Sea of 1959, invokes an aesthetic grandeur that is as intangible and ethereal as it is impressive and utterly irresistible. Widely exhibited internationally for almost half a century, Poems to the Sea has long been recognized as among the artist’s foremost triumphs, and is respected as a critical early touchstone for the subsequent evolution of his entire career. Executed at the beginning of a new chapter in the artist’s life, immersed in the prospect of a permanent existence in his newly adopted Italy, this revered masterpiece sits at the head of Twombly’s lifelong dialogue with the classical past, legends of the gods and the myths of ancient civilization. Permeated with the artist’s utterly inimitable, tremulous handwriting and exigent mark making, Poems to the Sea combines a transcription

Self-portraiture has played a role of unparalleled importance in the work of Francis Bacon. More so than any artist since Rembrandt, Bacon’s implacable self-portrayals weave an autobiographic thread through the exigent vicissitudes of an extraordinarily dramatic life. Lived with the deepest commitment to brutally seizing the vulnerable, vital and violent conditions of human existence in both his work and day-to-day being, Francis Bacon was an artist for whom the searing reality of life itself was the purpose. Nowhere is this more forcefully evident than in the haunting opus of Self-Portraiture. Executed in the artist’s eighth decade at the age of 71, Three Studies for a Self-Portrait, richly surmises a life’s worth of retrospect locked within an emphatically urgent scrutiny of Bacon’s iconic features. Belonging to a corpus of eleven triptych self-portrayals in Bacon’s standard 14

Yves Klein's Archisponge (RE 11), from 1960 is one of the most evocative and potent representations of his unique, and uncompromising art and, as reflected in its title, a summation of the artist's Sponge Relief series.  With its rich texture, color saturation and scatter of sponges, it alludes to the notion of a world other than our own.  Growing up on the Mediterranean coast, Klein was deeply affected by the void of sea and sky as uninterrupted spatial fields. Underlying his boundless creativity was an innate desire to venture beyond that which was concrete. Archisponge (RE 11) is a stunning masterpiece representing one of the most important works in the artist's legendary oeuvre. Klein signed his name with the additional appellation of ``le monochrome'' and Archisponge (RE 11) sings with the ravishing International Klein Blue. The textural addition of

Picasso's striking portrayal of two women reading belongs to the extraordinary group of canvases depicting Marie-Thérèse Walter, his beloved mistress during the early 1930s.  Distinguished by their rich coloration, harmonic curves and sweeping arabesques, these exceptional pictures are renowned as Picasso's most euphoric, sexually-charged, fantastical and inspired compositions, and they rank among the most instantly recognizable works of 20th century art.  In fact, of all the manifestations of Picasso's exceptionally prolific career, it is during his 'Marie-Thérèse period'  when his creative force was at its most powerful. Among the most monumental of these pictures is Femmes lisant (Deux personnages), created when Marie-Thérèse was firmly at the center of Picasso's artistic

Willem de Kooning’s paintings from 1977 have long been regarded as among the finest within his extensive oeuvre.  Prized for capturing the essence of the sea, the sand and the surf, the works from this pinnacle year are among de Kooning’s most dynamically expressive representations of nature and the Long Island landscape he loved.  De Kooning began spending summers in East Hampton in 1959 and frequently considered giving up his Broadway loft entirely, following the lead of his contemporaries Jackson Pollock and Arshile Gorky who had already escaped the urban commotion of Manhattan in favor of the countryside. By summer 1961, de Kooning had purchased a small house in Springs, East Hampton and the following winter, had found a piece of property nearby that was perfect for a studio.  In 1963 he had moved entirely out of New York and immersed himself in the light-filled,

Nu assis is an exceptional example of Renoir's key subject: the female nude in a landscape. More than any other avant-garde painter of the late nineteenth century aside from Degas, Renoir focused his energy on the subject of the female nude, and the results he achieved were both unique and striking.

The development of Renoir's style in depicting nudes draws from both his early experience as an Impressionist painter and the influence of a trip he took to Italy in 1881, when he went to see works by Raphael and other Renaissance masters. Renoir's approach to this subject underwent a series of transformations in the 1870s and 1880s, creating an aesthetic that would become the epitome of Renoir's art. In Nu assis, a seated female bather sits in profile with her legs carefully draped in a billowy sheet, with her eyes either partially or fully closed. The outdoor setting

Giacometti's Le Chat is one of the most recognizable and profound compositions of his post-war production.  Slinking along, with its body in perfect alignment, this graceful creature possesses an elegance akin to the artist's elongated female nudes.   Giacometti was fascinated by the dexterity and anatomical pliancy of the animal, which in its very nature embodies the illusionistic properties of so many of his narrow busts and standing figures.  ""A cat is narrow and can pass between two very close objects,"" Giacometti once marveled, holding his hands about five centimeters apart.   The cat's physical elusiveness was also fascinating to the Existentialists, which made Giacometti's cat all the more relevant when it was created in 1951.  Observing how the animal could

Danseuse dans le fauteuil, sol en damier brilliantly exemplifies what Matisse called ""the colour of ideas.""   This visually arresting canvas marked the begining of a revolutionary campaign in Matisse's art in the fall of 1942, when he would eliminate extraneous details that characterized his depictions of Odalisqes in the 1920s (fig. 2).  Instead, he turned his focus more exclusively towards the essential components of form and color.  The present work encapsulates this new direction of his art, with its sharp tonal color contrasts and confident, linear clarity.   ""I will now begin to paint with the same ardour as I have drawn,"" Matisse proclaimed in 1942, and surely this canvas has much of the same vigour and spontaneity of his drawings (quoted in Matisse, A Second Life (exhibition catalogue),

By Twos of 1949 is a moving and quintessential example of Barnett Newman’s inimitable contribution to the canon of American art during the critical years after the Second World War. In 1948, Newman painted Onement I, the canvas in which he felt he achieved the radical aesthetic breakthrough that he and his contemporaries each fervently believed was the higher purpose of the artist in the modern era.  Here, Newman’s signature motif – the vertical 'zip' – emerged and with a celebratory burst of energy, the next two years were the most productive of his career. In 1949, he painted eighteen canvases, the largest number he would ever produce in one year and a clear indication of the momentous creative epiphany experienced by Newman at this critical time. Yet, fully eleven of these works now reside in museum collections, including a rich trove of four to be found in New York

Monet’s Sous les Peupliers is amongst the finest evocations of the French countryside the artist committed to canvas during the 1880s. Its extraordinarily rich surface, composed using spontaneous brushwork and areas of thickly applied paint, exemplifies the technical virtuosity Monet had achieved by the end of the decade. The idyllic agrarian subject matter of this work encapsulates the central focus of Monet’s œuvre towards the end of the 19th Century; he divorced himself from painting urban scenes and the banlieue of Paris and devoted himself fully to his beloved countryside, with it majestic avenues of poplar trees, canals and wheat fields.

Painted in 1887, the present work was executed during a period of respite from extensive travelling. The previous year Monet undertook painting campaigns to Holland and Brittany, but had also finally established a permanent

Painted in 1964 at the heart of Andy Warhol's most historic period, Sixteen Jackies is a complex and extraordinarily rare declaration of the twin pedestals on which Warhol's artistic genius rest: ubiquitous public icons and serial imagery. A tour-de-force presentation of one of Warhol's most poignant images – his well-known series of portraits of the First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, as seen by millions through the press coverage surrounding her husband's assassination – Sixteen Jackies is also a powerful celebration of Warhol's inspired use of multiple image repetition as a thematic device.
In the early 1960s, Warhol's rows of soup cans and movie stars were screened within a single canvas. With the Jackie paintings, Warhol for the first time created numbers of small panels which he could later assemble into larger compositions. Against backgrounds of blues, white

Richly balanced, pure and absolute, Piero Manzoni’s elegant Achrome of 1961 presents an exemplary archetype of the artist’s desire to free the surface of painting by employing only the most primary of materials. Here Manzoni’s singular use of kaolin and cloth transcends the painterly gesture inherent to traditional post-war artistic production, refining the work to its most untouched, raw materiality. Indeed, Achrome is a testament to the artist’s own venerable words: “We absolutely cannot consider the picture as a space onto which to project our mental scenography. It is the area of freedom in which we search for the discovery of our first images. Images which are as

Marc's spectacularly colorful Der Wasserfall is a pivotal work of the German Expressionist movement, created at the dawning of a new era in 20th century painting.  It was completed in 1912, the same year that the seminal Blue Rider Almanac made its debut in Munich.  Marc and Wassily Kandinsky co-edited this publication, and in it they promoted a new artistic movement that rejected the regimented and systematized restrictions of urban life.  Marc in particular championed freedom of expression and a spiritualized, somewhat mystical, approach to representing the natural world.  This new type of art had aesthetic similarities to the wildly colorful compositions that the Fauves produced a few years earlier in France.  But the creative efforts and philosophies of Der Blaue Reiter group, as Marc, Kandinsky and their fellow collaborating

New York, Cheim & Read, Jean-Michel Basquiat: In Word Only, February - March 2005, p. 3, illustrated
Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.
Basquiat’s burgeoning stardom reached a climax in 1982, the year after Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) was created. The artist spent 1982 jet-setting around the world, appearing at major exhibitions, as each

Immediately identifiable as a major work from this twentieth-century master’s legendary oeuvre, Willem de Kooning’s Abstraction of the late 1940s belongs to a critical juncture in de Kooning's career and is, without question, one of the most serene works by the artist from this halcyon period. This sublime masterpiece is the exquisitely resolved summation of de Kooning’s faculty to transmogrify traces of the naturalistic domain into the abstract realm through an utterly seductive painterly economy. Here we witness a fully realized interplay of linear elegance, automatic gesture and sumptuous color. With its biomorphic central form, it exclaims a powerful sense of surrealist dislocation with a tremendous urgency that is at once both graphic and painterly. Tearing down the superficial veil of mere representation, de Kooning offers a new kind of experience: one that is not hindered

Giacometti's extraordinary Homme qui chavire is an instantly recognizable emblem of its era.  Caught in the instant he loses his balance, the legendary Falling Man, as he is known in translation, exists in a state of perpetual instability and in a moment of transcendence as he hurls towards the future.  His arms flail wildly, his head snaps backwards and his knees buckle just as he is about to drop from his cylindrical pedestal to whatever it is that awaits him.   The figure's shock and lack of control are exceedingly palpable in this dramatic image.  Giacometti's creation of this sculpture in 1950 coincided with his production of other career-defining bronzes, all featuring his signature attenuated figures, either standing like sentinels or in mid-stride across a plaza.  But the image of the man stumbling on the unsteady terrain of the modern

Resplendent with the morning light of the Mediterranean, The stunning Séance du matin captures the daily routine of the artist's studio in the south of France.  The model for this picture was Henriette Darricarrère, Matisse's studio assistant whose own interest in painting he encouraged by offering her lessons during their working time together.  The scene depicts Henriette at work on her own painting, but the focus, of course, is on Matisse's composition here. 

The picture boasts all of the key elements of the Nice-period paintings, with its colorful patterning and gleeming white highlights. Clear and brilliant daylight streams through the window, casting shadows on the floor around the furniture.  What is particularly extraordinary here is Matisse's bold and deliberate

From his legendary collages made with chair caning and newspaper to his sculpture of a bull's head made from a bicycle seat, Picasso's most ingenious works of art were often created from objects that he found in daily life (see fig. 1).  By the 1950s, he had taken this process a step further – assembling objects that he found in the environs of his home and casting them in plaster, and then casting the completed sculpture in bronze to unify the piece with a homogeneous medium.  Picasso often made preliminary sketches of these works, which detail how he would implement the miscellaneous objects within the body of the composition.   While working in his studio of Le Fournas in Vallauris between 1950-53, the artist executed a considerable number of these sculptures in the forms of goats, birds and other animals, creating a veritable menagerie from objets trouvés.

Jeanne Hébuterne (au chapeau) is one of Modigliani's first major portraits of the woman whose image came to define his art.  Jeanne Hébuterne was born on April 6, 1898 and was just 19 when she met Modigliani while studying art at the Académie Colarossi in 1916.  For the next three years until his death in 1920 and her tragic suicide the following day, she would be his constant companion and muse, immortalized in a number of portraits.  Although Jeanne was an artist herself, she remains known primarily through Modigliani's portraits of her.  By the time he started depicting Jeanne, the artist had developed his mature style, and the portraits of her, painted during the last three years of his life, are among his most refined and accomplished works.

Willem de Kooning returned his focus to painting in 1975 after two years of devoting himself primarily to making sculpture.  In this resurgence of artistic creativity and with a newfound confidence, de Kooning produced an extraordinary body of work that would soon become one of the most highly regarded series of his long career.  During this period, de Kooning experimented with varying levels of image abstraction and morphology.  The sunlight, dunes, bright

'The head sinks deeply into the darkness of her arms, drawn together above her breasts as though she were freezing. Her back is rounded, her neck almost horizontal, she bends forward as if listening to her own body in which a foreign future begins to take life.'
Rainer Maria Rilke
    One of the most significant works in his œuvre, Rodin’s striking conception of Eve was among the earliest figures modelled for, or at least in conjunction with, his great project for La Porte de l‘Enfer. Rodin began work on this in 1880 following an official commission for a monumental door to grace the entrance to the planned building for the new museum of decorative arts in Paris. Many of the sculptures planned for this project – including Eve – would ultimately evolve as separate works and are now considered to be among the artist’s greatest achievements.

Although approximately 150 sculptures in varying states of repair were found in Degas's studio after his death in 1917, only one sculpture had been exhibited during his lifetime, the Petite danseuse de quatorze ans. It was originally intended to be shown in the Fifth Impressionist Exhibition of 1880 and was in fact included in the catalogue as no. 34 – Petite danseuse de quatorze ans (statuette en cire) – but was not ready in time, and only the empty vitrine was sent. The following year, however, Degas was sufficiently satisfied with his figure to include it in the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition where it was listed as no. 12, although this time two weeks elapsed before the figure was placed in the empty glass case. The wax original that caused so much comment is now in the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (fig. 5). Using an armature probably

Schokko (Schokko mit Tellerhut) is one of the most powerful and stylised of all Jawlensky's female portraits of 1910. Her exotic appearance and elaborate appeal notwithstanding, the model was a young girl from a village near Munich. Before posing in Jawlensky's cold studio, she liked to drink a cup of hot chocolate and her requests for 'a cup of Schokko' led to the nickname given to her by the Jawlenskys.

Looking back at the pre-war years, the artist himself identified this phase in his career as crucial: 'I painted my finest...figure paintings in powerful, glowing colours and not at all naturalistic or objective. I used a great deal of red, blue, orange, cadmium yellow and chromium-oxide green. My forms were very strongly contoured in Prussian blue and came with tremendous power from an inner ecstasy...It was a turning point in my art.

Trois hommes qui marchent I epitomises Giacometti's mature style developed during the years immediately following World War II, characterised by the tall, slender figures for which he is best known. No longer interested in recreating physical likenesses in his sculptures, the artist began working from memory, seeking to capture his figures beyond the physical reality of the human form. Giacometti elongated the vertical axis while reducing the thickness of his sculptures: the men in the present work are thus composed of thin lines, lending the composition a weightless, almost impalpable quality. The image of a man can be interpreted as a symbolic representation of the artist himself and, in a wider context of the post-war period, as a reflection of the lonely and vulnerable human condition, a theme that very much preoccupied the artist at this time.

“Modigliani was ‘noblesse excédée’ to use Baudelaire’s phrase which fits him beautifully. I was instantly struck by his extraordinary talent and I wanted to do something for him. I bought his drawings and canvases, but I was his only buyer and I wasn’t rich. I introduced him to my family. He already had, ingrained in him, the certainty of his own worth. He knew that he was a ground-breaker and not an imitator, but so far he had no commissions. I asked him to paint a portrait of my father, my brother Jean and several of myself” (Noël Alexandre, Modigliani inconnu, Paris, 1993, p. 59).
These lines by Paul Alexandre reveal the decisive role the young doctor played in the ascendance of Amedeo Modigliani’s career and reflect his deep admiration for his artist friend. Paul Alexandre was completing his internship at the hospital Lariboisière in November 1907 when he met Modigliani,

Saturated with the brilliant blue, green and steely gray tones of the river at mid-day, Le Pont d'Argenteuil et la Seine is a stunning example of Impressionist landscape painting at its most visually dynamic.  Caillebotte's landscapes of the 1870s and 1880s consistently evoked the rapid modernization of the Seine valley through the development of iron bridges, railroad stations and new boulevards, and Le Pont d'Argenteuil et la Seine is considered to be one of his most profound testaments to these bold structural transformations.  When Le Pont d'Argenteuil et la Seine was featured in the Caillebotte exhibition in Paris and Los Angeles, Anne Distel singled out this picture as ""incontestably one of the most successful works executed by Caillebotte on the banks of the Seine"" (A.

Richter's Gudrun from 1987 is a fascinating and visually explosive work that references Gudrun Ensslin, a founding member of the German youth protest group, the Red Army Faction. With its eponymous title, Gudrun represents one of the rare instances in which Richter's famed mode of gestural abstraction here incorporates a more charged character than his usual treatise on the abstract nature of art. The color palette of Gudrun, in which a potent red visually collides with strong black diagonals and veils highlights in yellow, blue and green, provides this painting with a sumptuous and visual muscularity. This intense optical vitality is wedded to an equally forceful and contrapuntal geometric construct, as the pulsating red is joined by a dramatic and vigorous black upsweep of Richter's signature squeegee tool. It is telling that this abstract work is the precursor

Painted in 1930, Le Baiser is a bold, linear rendering of a kissing couple painted on a cabinet door. In the present work, the two figures are depicted in profile, filling the board with an explosive force. When the artist completed this grippingly imaginative composition, he was at the end of his involvement with the Surrealist movement. Limiting his palette to two contrasting colors of black-and-white, Picasso relied upon the cinematic effect of transparency to create this phantasmagoric image. When we regard Le Baiser in isolation, the central focus appears to be two transparent heads with a dagger-like tongues projecting from the figure’s mouths.  In other versions of this theme, the artist's ghostly head is much more legible, often relegated to the edge of the composition while the sharp-toothed monster looms

Odalisques jouant aux dames is a powerful and bold rendering of the theme of odalisques, one of the most spectacular and fascinating series of Matisse's œuvre. Painted while the artist was living in Nice and during what is considered his most accomplished period as a colourist, the composition combines the most important elements of his painting: a rich, bold palette developed during the Fauve years, a fascination with texture and patterns, and the exotic, orientalist setting. Odalisques jouant aux dames belongs to his celebrated series of works executed in the 1920s, showing nudes or female figures in exotic garments depicted in lush interiors. In 1928 Matisse painted several compositions in which these figures are shown seated or reclining around a checkerboard, whose black-and-white pattern stands in contrast with the more rounded shapes of the females

Painted in 1930, Le Baiser is a bold, linear rendering of a kissing couple painted on a cabinet door. In the present work, the two figures are depicted in profile, filling the board with an explosive force. When the artist completed this grippingly imaginative composition, he was at the end of his involvement with the Surrealist movement. Limiting his palette to two contrasting colors of black-and-white, Picasso relied upon the cinematic effect of transparency to create this phantasmagoric image. When we regard Le Baiser in isolation, the central focus appears to be two transparent heads with a dagger-like tongues projecting from the figure’s mouths.  In other versions of this theme, the artist's ghostly head is much more legible, often relegated to the edge of the composition while the sharp-toothed monster looms

Since my pictures are large, colorful and unframed, and since museum walls are usually immense and formidable, there is the danger that the pictures relate themselves as decorative areas to the walls. This would be a distortion of their meaning, since the pictures are intimate and intense, and are the opposite of what is decorative.
(Mark Rothko, 1954)
Mark Rothko is universally regarded as one of the preeminent artists of his generation; closely identified with the New York School, his art, like Jackson Pollock’s and Willem de Kooning’s, remains one of the most celebrated dialects of the collective Abstract Expressionist language. For nearly half a century, Rothko developed an impassioned form of abstract painting; one that transformed painted color into emotive experience. The 1940s saw him adopt a biomorphic style close to that of his fellow Abstract

Giacometti's extraordinary ensemble, Trois hommes qui marchent II, is an instantly recognisable icon of Modern art. Captured in mid-stride, the figures personify the theme of being alone in a crowd, as they narrowly pass each other in disconnected paths. The psychological isolation of each figure is underscored by the weighted feet, firmly rooted to their base and mobilised as their heels lift off the ground. Giacometti's creation of this sculpture at the end of the 1940s coincided with his production of other career-defining bronzes, all featuring his signature attenuated figures, either standing or in mid-stride across a plaza. But this image of the psychological isolation is perhaps Giacometti's most literal attempt to personify his own existential preoccupations in the years following the war. And to the Existentialist philosophers themselves, this very image became

This depiction of Saint Rufina is widely considered by scholars to have been painted by Velázquez during the early years of the 1630s, slightly preceding or shortly following the Spanish master’s first trip to Italy in around 1630-31. The subject of Saint Rufina would have held particular significance for Velázquez as she was – and remains to this day – a patron saint of his native city of Seville, the very town in which he underwent his artistic training before leaving to work in the employ of Philip IV in Madrid in the summer of 1623.
Dr. Peter Cherry1 dates the painting to circa 1632-34 on the basis of its close stylistic and technical affinities with Velázquez’s painting of A Sybil of circa 1631, today in the Museo del Prado, Madrid (see figure 1).2 Both figures are painted with a powerful realism that suggests the models were taken

""A perfect work of the Venetian school"".1
This painting is one of the most important multi-figural compositions by the artist remaining in private hands and is the finest work by the artist to come onto the open market for two decades.  It is a mature work, painted circa 1560, when Titian was at the height of his powers and had established his reputation as the leading artist in Europe.  It is a composition that is at once monumental but also extremely tender and as Titian's last known Sacra Conversazione it is the culmination of his lifelong exploration of this theme in Venetian art.  The painting also has a remarkable provenance: during the almost half millennium since it was painted it has only changed hands six times, moving from one illustrious private European collection to another and rarely appearing in public at exhibition or at auction.

Representing the highest tier of Jeff Koons' artistic achievement, Pink Panther from 1988 is immediately identifiable as a masterpiece not only of the artist's historic canon, but also of the epoch of recent Contemporary Art. It conflates the classic themes that define Jeff Koons' output - materiality and artificiality, eroticism and naivety, popular culture and rarefied elitism – and is, quite simply, the model expression of one of the most innovative and influential artists of our times. The elite edition of three plus one artist's proof is immensely illustrious: one version is housed in the Museum of Modern Art, New York and another resides in the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. Following the spectacular successes of major exhibitions at Versailles; Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; and the Serpentine Gallery,

Le Livre illustrates what Gris described as his “deductive method,” in which he set out to craft a composition with abstract shapes which would, through the painterly process, slowly materialize into figurative forms. It has been written that Gris’ output was ever marked “by a refinement of calculation and a highly original colour sense which have won him his separate place in Cubism's front rank. [The artist] remained throughout his life a solitary seeker whose calm, detached sobriety of mind was reflected as an art of ascetic purity” (Juan Gris (exhibition catalogue), The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1958, n.p.).
Firmly locked into place by a series of overlapping planes, the present composition features many of the iconic elements that comprise so many Cubist still lifes—the open book, bowl, knife and fruit, their stark organization a direct nod to

A masterwork of Surrealism, Printemps nécrophilique embodies the ineffable mystery so particular to Dalí's oeuvre. As early as 1928, the artist had embraced Surrealism as evidenced by early masterpieces, including Portrait de Paul Éluard (fig. 2). By the time he painted this work in 1936, he had established the style and the personal iconography that characterizes his most successful compositions. The eerie infusion of dreamscape with hyper-real figural elements is a hallmark of Dalí's approach. The voice which he gives to the subconscious world is at once personal and universal. The current work, painted at the height of his most creative years in Paris, exemplifies his unique aesthetic at its most refined and sensational.
Dalí depicts two figures in this work that offer a confounding combination of anonymity and specificity. He envelops the

Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.
Basquiat’s burgeoning stardom reached a climax in 1982, the year after Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) was created. The artist spent 1982 jet-setting around the world, appearing at major exhibitions, as each

Visual aesthetics, rigorous use of composition and astute choice of subject matter come together in Andy Warhol’s, Suicide, 1964, to create a work of power, beauty and tragedy.  After decades of modernist abstraction, Pop Art restored representation and objective imagery to painting, reflecting the world in which it thrived via electronic and print media.  Many interpreted the subject matter of Pop Art as too readily recognizable and easily accessible and did not realize the deeper conceptual aesthetic issue that was central to Warhol’s oeuvre - how modern media was affecting modern life and consciousness.  Andy Warhol stands as one of the most acute observers of this phenomenon.  Suicide is an outstanding example of the artist’s Death and Disaster series that reveals Warhol’s pre-occupation with the contradictions inherent in public and private

This extraordinarily compact, block-like sculpture was conceived in Paris in the winter of 1906-07 and is one of Picasso’s most important early bronzes. The group of works made between the autumn of 1906 and 1909 posed new questions hitherto unknown in European sculpture, putting them on a par with Picasso’s work as a painter and draftsman. Reduced to the essentials, the schematic treatment of the almond-shaped eyes, the smooth surface and the symmetrical features of this piece create the impression of perfect serenity.

“This mask-like object is the sculptural consequence of a radical transition in Picasso’s pictorial and graphic work from a portrait-like conception of the head to a form of expressive stylization” writes Werner Spies. “For the first time, Picasso obtains a sculptural representation in which dependence on received patterns and an interest in autonomous, compositionally

Toulouse-Lautrec’s images of the maisons closes are considered to be his greatest accomplishments, and Au lit: le baiser is an especially beautiful and vibrant example of these important works. Painted in 1892, the present work is one of a series of four compositions (figs. 1 & 2) in which Lautrec depicts a moment of tender intimacy between two women. For the present work Lautrec chose a viewpoint almost unique in his œuvre, and certainly unique among the other works of this group. The two young women are pictured in a loving embrace, with their bodies foreshortened so that all that is visible of them are their intertwined arms and their closely interlocked faces. The result is a painting of extraordinary intimacy, and one that is among Lautrec’s most psychologically insightful works.

Monet’s Les Peupliers à Giverny presents a sublime sunset seen through two rows of poplar trees which stood on the edge of the fields at Ajoux between Giverny and the Seine. This wonderfully evocative image is imbued with the rose and gold-hued light of early autumn. The extraordinarily rich surface, composed using vigorous brushwork and areas of dappling paint, exemplifies the technical virtuosity Monet had achieved by the end of the decade. The idyllic rural subject matter of this work encapsulates the central focus of Monet’s œuvre towards the end of the 19th Century; he divorced himself from painting urban scenes and the banlieue of Paris and devoted himself fully to his beloved countryside, with its majestic avenues of poplar trees, canals and wheat fields.

The idyllic rural compositions Monet executed in the Eure during the late 1880s offer a vision of pastoral

Among Monet’s most celebrated and visually spectacular canvases are his depictions of floating ice on the Seine.  These majestic compositions exemplify his talent for capturing the nuances of the natural world in flux, and Glaçons, effet blancis among the most elegant.   This view of the left bank and the islet of Forée from Bennecourt belongs to a series of fifteen river views completed during the winter of 1892-93.  Monet painted this composition in early January 1893, while the temperatures were still frigid enough to create the atmospheric drama that we see here. Through the haze of frosty air, the large sheets of ice have begun to break apart on the surface of the river as they drift downstream, while the banks and treetops in the distance glisten with the melting snow.   By the end of the month, the thaw brought Monet’s campaign to an abrupt

1949 was a seminal year for Francis Bacon: it marked the full inauguration of an artistic vision that drew back the veil on the human condition with a rawness and violence never before witnessed. This was the year of Bacon’s very first one-man exhibition in which the extraordinary and historically important group of six Heads powerfully proclaimed his critical arrival. Designated as third in this crucial series, Head III was conceived as part of the most ferocious corpus of Bacon’s early career; a sequence of paint encrusted, starkly monochromatic pictures that navigates an evolution from the innate animalism of Heads I and II (housed in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and Ulster Museum, Belfast respectively) to culminate in Head VI (Southbank Centre, London) as the very first in Bacon’s groundbreaking and iconoclastic

ENGRAVED
in mezzotint (in reverse) by Benjamin Green, as Brood Mares, and inscribed; The Original Picture is in the Possession of the Honourable Colonel Parker: LONDON Publish'd as the Act directs, May 10: 1768
This painting is a peaceful masterpiece, the very epitome of tranquillity and harmony.  Commissioned by one of the artist's most important patrons and remaining in the collection of his descendants until today, the painting has survived in remarkable condition and demonstrates to the full Stubbs's flawless, technical ability. Without a hint of ostentation, this iconic work defines the genre in which George Stubbs remains the un-surpassed master.
Painted in 1768, when the artist was firmly established in London and was enjoying considerable success, the painting forms part of a celebrated series of paintings that Stubbs produced for some of his most important patrons during the course of that decade.  In such paintings, Stubbs was able to gratify his patrons through the celebration and immortalisation of their most prized personal possession – the race-horse.

Braque’s magnificent depiction of La Ciotat in the south of France is a seminal image of the Fauve revolution at the beginning of the twentieth century. The jubilant hues Braque used to create this vibrant image owe less to nature and more to his own emotional response to the landscape (figs 1, 5).  ""Nature,"" Braque said in 1908 ""is a mere pretext for decorative composition, plus sentiment. It suggests emotion, and I translate emotion into art"" (quoted in Masters of Colour: Derain to Kandinsky  (exhibition catalogue), Royal Academy of Arts, London, 2002, p. 131).

Braque's depictions of the environs of Provence rank among the most expressive and desirable of the Fauve landscapes (figs. 2, 3, 5).  The inception of these rare and extraordinary canvases dates from the period immediately after the fall of 1905, when Matisse, Derain and

Monet's spectacular images of the Japanese bridge spanning the lily pond of his lush garden at Giverny of the most recognizable images of 20th century art.  These pictures capture the mystique of the meticulously-landscaped environment that served as Monet's inspiration during his later career.  The present picture, which is one of the most richly painted in the series, can be seen in a photograph of the artist's Giverny studio,  where it hangs in completion among other notable examples of the artist's late production.
Monet's bridge had powerful symbolic resonance when it was painted in the years after World War I.  As the bridge had been a symbol of progress for late 19th century artists, it was now also a signifier of the mending of nations and the joining of cultural forces.  Between 1918

This beautiful drawing was in Matisse's personal collection until his death, and then it was inherited by the artist's son Jean.  Dr. Albert Barnes and Violette de Mazia included it in their important 1933 study on the artist's work, and discussed it in the following terms:  ""The drawings fall into three general types.  The characteristic note of one of them is modeling both of figures and objects by juxtaposed areas of light and shadow, which are accentuated in varying degree to yield corresponding variations in three-dimensional quality.  Objects of all sorts are given the shape of fairly definite geometrical forms, and their composition produces a sort of irregular checkerboard or patchwork effect. (Albert C. Barnes and Violette de Mazia, The Art of Henri Matisse, Pennsylvania, 1933, discussed pp. 185-86).

With an incredibly executed, glistening halo of flaming light at its compositional heart, and a perfectly balanced atmospheric spectrum of hues, Kerze radiates inspirational tranquillity and is the shining embodiment of Hubertus Butin's statement that ""no still-life motif has been such an object of fascination for Richter as the subject of the candle"" (Hubertus Butin, Ed., Gerhard Richter: Editions 1965-2004: Catalogue Raisonné, Ostfildern-Ruit 2004, p. 67). A paragon of the Photo Painting style that Richter had perfected since the early 1960s, this work is both iconic and exceptionally beautiful via its masterful veiling of light within the flawlessly composed space. The profound serenity of the quietly flickering flame is matched by the exceptional dexterity of the work's painterly execution.

This extraordinarily compact, block-like sculpture was conceived in Paris in the winter of 1906-07 and is one of Picasso’s most important early bronzes. The group of works made between the autumn of 1906 and 1909 posed new questions hitherto unknown in European sculpture, putting them on a par with Picasso’s work as a painter and draftsman. Reduced to the essentials, the schematic treatment of the almond-shaped eyes, the smooth surface and the symmetrical features of this piece create the impression of perfect serenity.

“This mask-like object is the sculptural consequence of a radical transition in Picasso’s pictorial and graphic work from a portrait-like conception of the head to a form of expressive stylization” writes Werner Spies. “For the first time, Picasso obtains a sculptural representation in which dependence on received patterns and an interest in autonomous, compositionally

L’Embarcadère is one of Monet’s most accomplished and resolved depictions of Zaandam executed during his time in Holland. Imbued with the all the charm of his views of the Seine, the present work’s fashionably dressed figures and sentimental palette display the quintessential qualities of the artist’s Impressionist style. Paintings such as L'Embarcadère helped Monet attain the status of the pre-eminent painter of modern life. His approach to painting was directly in opposition to the staid, academic manner of his predecessors, but was a tour-de-force of painterly invention and astute observation. The leisurely atmosphere of L’Embarcadère is underpinned by a remarkably complex ensemble of figure-studies, architectural elements and skilful depiction of light. In the present work the remarkably varied

Rodin’s Le Penseur has become one of the most recognizable sculptures in art history. The works pertinence to Rodin's contemporaries was immediate and its continued relevance in today's visual culture has solidified the sculpture's legacy. Though he firmly grounded Le Penseurin intellectual history, Rodin transcended preceding imagery to create a true masterpiece that continues to transfix contemporary society.

Rodin first conceived of the model in 1880-81 to crown the tympanum of his monumental Gates of Hell (fig. 1).  The figure was intended to represent Dante, surrounded by the characters of his Divine Comedy, but soon took on an independent life. ""Thin and ascetic in his straight gown,"" Rodin wrote later, ""my Dante would have been meaningless once divorced from the overall work. Guided by my initial inspiration, I conceived another

Painted in 1890, Effet de printemps à Giverny is a work of superlative quality, representing the pinnacle of Monet's Impressionist style.  The rich painterly surface and the artist's unbridled brushstrokes convey the unique atmosphere and the lustrous quality of light which so inspired Monet as he painted en plein air in Giverny, just a few kilometres from his home.  The present work belongs to a series of canvases depicting fields of hay, oats and poppies in which the artist's rigorous application of paint, Paul Hayes Tucker suggests, indicates that Monet had become more concerned not only with overall atmospheric effects but also with emphasizing the decorative, tapestry-like qualities that painting can achieve.  It therefore marks a subtle yet important turning point in Monet's style, as well as the emergence of an idea that was to dominate that artist's

Of all the fabled personae in Picasso’s repertoire, the harlequin is his most poignant.  This figure, traditionally associated with the theater of the Italian 17th century Commedia dell'Arte, came to be known in the 20th century as the symbol of Picasso's art.   He would appear recurrently throughout the artist's career as a central character, such as in his stage set  designs after the war, or as a vehicle for artistic expression in the highly geometricized Cubist constructions of the 1910s.   At the end of his life Picasso would resurrect the harlequin in the form of a musketeer, symbolizing the beginning of his artistic expression and the creative force behind his entire production.   The present work is one of his earliest depictions of this iconic character, and is a composition

Modigliani reveled in exposing the sensuality of his female sitters.  Among the most provocative of his works are his portraits of his lover Jeanne Hébuterne (1898-1920) (see fig. 1), who was his primary model and muse during the last years of his life (see fig. 2).  Jeanne was about 20 at the time the artist painted the present portrait in 1918 and two years into a romantic relationship with the artist that would last until his death in 1920.  The present portrait is one in a series that Modigliani completed in 1918, depicting Jeanne in profile.  The linearity of her form recalls the finely chiseled stone carvings that Modigliani had executed seven years earlier (see fig. 3).   Her elongated features, particularly the graceful curve of her slender neck, appealed to the Mannerist-inspired aesthetic that Modigliani had developed

Suffused with the brilliant light of the South of France, Boléro violet is an exquisite portrait from one of the most important and creative periods of Matisse’s art. The arrangement of the exotically dressed girl, with her upper body posed diagonally across the painting, is invitingly intimate, with the sweeping arm of her chair creating a subtle distinction between the position of the model and the picture's surface. The emphasis Matisse placed on decorative patterns is particularly apparent in Boléro violet. The buttercup gold and orange striped wallpaper, vivid purple coat and strikingly stylised features of the model - her dark hair and red lips being especially pronounced - combine to create a beguiling vision of the artist’s opulent domain.

The model in the painting is Princess Hélène Galitzine, daughter of Russian aristocrat Prince Serge Galitzine

A rare masterpiece of ""anti-painting"", Tête humaine provides a glimpse into the development of Miró's personal iconography. Resistant to categorization, Miró rejected labels and artistic agendas, choosing instead to discover a profoundly individual artistic vocabulary. Miró painted the current work during an intensely creative moment in his career, a time when he broke away from discernible influences and created wholly unique works. He generates here an eloquent dialogue between painting and the incorporation of found objects. Though redolent of both Dadaism and Surrealism, with a visionary expression, Tête humaine transcends the movements that dominated European Modernism at the time.  
Throughout the 1920s, Miró fostered an autonomous identity amid the circle of artists active in Paris. Associating with the Dadaists and subsequently

A rhapsodic symphony in an ever-evolving cycle
Zao Wou-Ki’s seminal masterpiece from the “oracle bone period”

“The wind is soaring, the water roars. Movements of the cosmos travel across the canvas from one side to another, like a wild horse on the loose. The sky is shrouded with thick, dark clouds, the sea rough with waves. As the tide of nature returns over and again, this enormous power passes through all the ages…the painter has found the great way of light, colors and materials, returning with their secrets in hand. This is no simple return – with his unique perspectives, the artist has opened up for us a world of shapes and forms, derived from the inner universe of external appearances.” These are comments from former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin on Zao Wou-Ki’s paintings, an interpretation filled with poetry

Odalisque grise et jaune is one of Matisse's provocative depictions of an odalisque, reclining in a position that best exploits the inviting curves of her flesh.   Painted while the artist was living in Nice and during what is considered his most accomplished period as a colorist, the composition presents a medley of Matisse's greatest achievements as a painter and draftsman.  He poses the figure reclining with her arm above her head, a position that appeared in several of his paintings, drawings and sculptures of this period (see figs. 1, 2, and 3).  The artist himself once made the following remarks with regard to the subject that arguably dominates his oeuvre: “The odalisques were the bounty of a happy nostalgia, a lovely, vivid dream, and the almost ecstatic, enchanted days and nights of the Moroccan climate.

Renoir's splendid La Loge of 1874 is a smaller version of the iconic oil of the same date and title (fig. 1), now in the collection of the Courtauld Institute Galleries in London. Capturing the spirit that defined the avant-garde movement, La Loge has become one of the images most commonly associated with Impressionist painting. The scene depicts a bourgeois couple seated in their box at the Paris opera house, where the main attraction is dependant on one's point of view. In this composition, Renoir presents us with a female figure who looks directly at the viewer, while her male companion looks up towards another member of the audience rather than down towards the stage. The act of looking and being looked at were central concerns to the Impressionists as they documented scenes of modern life, and at the opera and ballet both the performers and audience were

This extraordinarily compact, block-like sculpture was conceived in Paris in the winter of 1906-07 and is one of Picasso’s most important early bronzes. The group of works made between the autumn of 1906 and 1909 posed new questions hitherto unknown in European sculpture, putting them on a par with Picasso’s work as a painter and draftsman. Reduced to the essentials, the schematic treatment of the almond-shaped eyes, the smooth surface and the symmetrical features of this piece create the impression of perfect serenity.

“This mask-like object is the sculptural consequence of a radical transition in Picasso’s pictorial and graphic work from a portrait-like conception of the head to a form of expressive stylization” writes Werner Spies. “For the first time, Picasso obtains a sculptural representation in which dependence on received patterns and an interest in autonomous, compositionally

This transfixing portrait is one in a series of canvases that Giacometti devoted to depicting Caroline, his lover and primary model during the early 1960s (see fig. 1).  Between 1959 and until Giacometti's death in 1965, Caroline would become the artist's main source of inspiration, and her image all but replaced that of Annette's in his paintings, drawings and sculpture (see figs. 2 & 3).  This deeply intimate picture, painted in the midst of their complicated and often volatile relationship, reveals what exactly the artist saw in this young woman, whom he once described as  ""a golden sphere (not a sphere, something else, but made of gold) with green eyes that smolder (no, that radiate) intensity"" (quoted in Véronique Wiesinger, ""On Women in Giacometti's Work (And Some Women in Particular),"" in The Women of Giacometti

``I've been influenced by painting very much; but if I have avoided saying that, it was because of the general inclination until very recently to believe that art exists in art. At every opportunity, I've tried to correct that idea, suggesting that art is only a part - one of the elements that we live with.''
--Robert Rauschenberg, 1968
Robert Rauschenberg looms large as a key figure of American art at the mid-century, bridging the Abstract Expressionist years of the 1950s through the Pop and Minimalist era of the 1960s. Rauschenberg's hybrid inventions of new forms of art, most notably the Combine Paintings and the Silkscreen Paintings such as Overdrive embodied the shared impulse of the younger artist eager to strip away the recent past and re-examine the nature of painting on their own terms. Embracing the wealth of innovation in aesthetic theory throughout

In 1932, the 51-year-old Picasso painted some of his most celebrated portraits of his significantly younger mistress, Marie-Thérèse Walter.  He had met her in Paris some years before when she was only a teenager, and the wealth of images she inspired during the late 1920s and early 1930s has been acclaimed as one of the greatest achievements of the artist's career. Picasso's relationship with Marie-Thérèse was kept a well-guarded secret, not only because of his marriage to Olga Kokhlova, but because of her age.   Nevertheless, in 1931 her presence - which had already begun to infiltrate his work, notably in the series of bathers at Dinard in 1928 and 1929 - became the catalyst for a crucial new departure in his work.   This picture, painted in 1932, is a rare dual-portrait of the artist watching his young lover as she sleeps.

Monet’s paintings of the river at Argenteuil are among the crowning achievements of Impressionist art. Painted in loose brushstrokes and imbued with light and movement, La Seine à Argenteuil is an exquisite example from this series and a masterful illustration of the Impressionist style. The work was painted in 1875, during the years when Monet made Argenteuil his permanent home, and it perfectly captures the combination of rural charm and modernity that first attracted Monet to the town and made it a place of such significance for his fellow Impressionists.
Long praised as an idyllic rural retreat, in the 1870s Argenteuil offered the perfect escape for Parisians seeking a break from the increasingly industrialised capital. Peter Worms, a resident of the town, described the view from the main bridge in 1869, ‘Right away, you notice the magnificent basin of the Seine, where in

The present work was executed in 1969 when, at almost 90, Picasso’s own physical stamina had inevitably waned, yet his focus on erotic subjects in his paintings and drawings only intensified. Rendered with a confident and free-flowing line, this image of a reclining nude is one of pure sensuality and takes the odalisque paintings of Ingres and Matisse as clear references. The figure reclines languorously and her contortions evoke some of Picasso's most sensual depictions of the voluptuous Marie-Thérèse from the 1930s while also recalling the drama of his masterpieces like La Femme qui pleure with the figure’s gnarled fingers and contorted head. It is Picasso's innate ability to combine his dream-like, voluptuous imagery with the energetic confrontation of his strong line which makes Nu couché a master example of his late work.

Composition with Red, Yellow and Blue is a major oil from a seminal period in Mondrian’s career, during which he laid down the austere strictures of Neo-Plasticism. Painted in 1927, it is a pristine example of Mondrian’s unique style that evolved through his resolute pursuit of a purified aesthetic vision. His project, to liberate painting from the domination of sensory perception and articulate universal principles that would give a new spiritual dimension to art, would become a template for both the aesthetic and the ideals of Modernism.
  Mondrian’s return from the Netherlands to his studio in Paris (fig. 4) in 1919 marked the beginning of a period of intense activity devoted to developing the style that would dominate his work of the 1920s. The return to an urban environment was a crucial influence; as the artist himself commented: ‘In the metropolis,

Jerry Saltz, ‘Out of the Fog’, The Village Voice, 20 December 1999, installation view
Country-rock (wing-mirror) is distinctly Doig: nostalgic without being specifically reminiscent, entrenched in fabled Canadian roots, and characterised by his trademark otherworldliness. The rainbow tunnel off the Don Valley Parkway, or DVP, is a view immediately familiar to any Toronto resident. Situated within a small valley in the parklands that surround the Don River, the tunnel was built in 1961 at the same time as the mammoth six-lane highway that today forms a major artery in and out of the city. A view from the passenger seat of a car, Peter Doig’s mysterious landscape utterly encapsulates the familiar ennui of such peripheral spaces. In concert with the ever-expanding urban sprawl, these places represent a terra incognitaof concrete and shrubland. The rainbow underpass however is a jarring interruption of the cultural no-man’s land that borders the flow of speeding

Les Usines is Léger's pictorial exaltation of the modern age.  Created shortly after the end of the First World War, it is a gleaming symbol of technological progress in an age of rapid industrialization.   At the time Léger painted this work, the prevailing philosophy in  war-torn Europe was focused on the rebuilding of nations.  The theme of a factory – the center of industrialization –  was the perfect incarnation of this sentiment, and Léger has rendered it here with a sense of robustness befitting the energy and determination of the time (see fig. 1). 
The composition is painted with a vibrant palette of primary colors that Léger carried over from the Contraste de Formes series that had occupied him during the war (see fig.

Claude Monet’s famous lily pond in his garden at Giverny provided the subject matter for most of his major later works, paintings whose significance in the development of modern art is now fully recognised. The theme of waterlilies, that became not only Monet’s most celebrated series of paintings, but possibly one of the most iconic images of the Impressionist movement, dominated the artist’s work over several decades, recording the changes in his style and his constant pictorial innovations. The present monumental oil, which dates from 1914-17, is a powerful testament to Monet’s enduring vision and creativity in his mature years. This work and the other in this series led to the celebrated Grandes décorations, now in the Musée de l’Orangerie in Paris, which are according to Daniel Wildenstein ‘the crowning glory of Monet’s career, in which all his work seemed to culminate’ (D.

Piero Manzoni cited in: Exh. Cat., London, Tate Gallery, Piero Manzoni: Paintings, Reliefs and Objects, March - May 1974, p. 47
Richly balanced, pure and absolute, Piero Manzoni’s elegant Achrome of 1961 presents an exemplary archetype of the artist’s desire to free the surface of painting by employing only the most primary of materials. Here Manzoni’s singular use of kaolin and cloth transcends the painterly gesture inherent to traditional post-war artistic production, refining the work to its most untouched, raw materiality. Indeed, Achrome is a testament to the artist’s own venerable words: “We absolutely cannot consider the picture as a space onto which to project our mental scenography. It is the area of freedom in which we search for the discovery of our first images. Images which are as

The spectacular Barques au port de Collioure presents the pinnacle of Derain's Fauve style.  In early July 1905, Derain joined Matisse in Collioure, a coastal town on the Spanish border, where both artists spent the next two months working side by side.  Shortly after Derain's arrival, he wrote in a letter to Vlaminck, marveling at the brilliant colors of the sundrenched coastal towns: ""Above all, the light, a blond light, a golden hue that suppresses the shadows.""  While in Collioure, Derain's preoccupation with light and color of the Mediterranean freed his palette, leading him to explore a new purified form of painting where strongly contrasting areas of colour came to achieve new prominence.  When Derain arrived in Collioure, Matisse, under the influence of Signac and Cross, was painting in brilliant, intense tones in a framework of mosaic-like

In the 1940s and 1950s, American artists followed the modernist example of abandoning traditional artistic genres and styles in favor of reexaminations that shattered long-held tenets and startled the art audience and critics. Realistic subject matter, such as still-lifes, landscapes and figuration, gave way to abstraction in many forms that expressed the inner impulse of the artist in response to the society around him. Younger artists of the 1960s, Roy Lichtenstein key among them, were no less eager to find their own radical aesthetic means to challenge the style championed by the generation before them, in this case de Kooning, Pollock, Rothko and the other giants of the New York School. With a great sense of irony, many chose to subvert the equation, turning it on its head with a puckish sense of wit and independence. In the case of Lichtenstein, he returned to the realism of painting

They give to his paintings a terrible beauty that has placed them among the most memorable images in the entire history of art"" (Exh. Cat., London, Tate Gallery, Francis Bacon, 1985, p. 7).

Willem de Kooning returned his focus to painting in 1975 after two years of devoting himself primarily to making sculpture.  In this resurgence of artistic creativity and with a newfound confidence, de Kooning produced an extraordinary body of work that would soon become one of the most highly regarded series of his long career.  During this period, de Kooning experimented with varying levels of image abstraction and morphology.  The sunlight, dunes, bright

""I paint because the spirits whisper madly inside my head"" - El Greco

This Saint Dominic in prayer is one of the finest and most characteristic examples of El Greco’s art to be offered for sale for more than a decade, and amongst the finest of all his many depictions of saints.  It is notable for its encapsulation of both the artist’s extraordinary mind and imagination and his highly individual technique; his embracing and juxtaposition of a transcendental environment with a very personal and earthly depiction of the saint himself.  Few devotional works are painted with such immediacy, vibrancy and confidence and yet in their scale and subject retain such an individual personality and intimacy. It is thus that with Titian, his greatest influence, El Greco can be considered the finest and most influential inventor of the second half of the sixteenth century.

Painted in 1907, Der Bär is a wonderful example of the transitional period in Kandinsky's œuvre, introducing a style of painting that prefigures the artist's development towards abstraction. At that time Kandinsky often favoured themes from Russian fairytales and folklore whereby the bear is invoked as a quintessentially Russian subject. The folkloric, almost two-dimensional quality of the composition and the use of linear brushstrokes evoke the influence of the technique of medieval glass painting whilst the brushwork reflects the influence of Post-Impressionist painters, such as Van Gogh. The liberty taken with colour by the Fauve painters whose works Kandinsky had seen in Paris in 1905-07 had been a revelation, pointing the way towards the invention of a pictorial language that would free painting from the object.

Giacometti's remarkable Homme traversant une place par un matin de soleil is an instantly recognisable icon of Modern art. Captured in mid-stride, the figure’s weighted front foot is firmly rooted to the base while the other heel lifts off the ground, and the entire figure is defined by the diagonal line of the body as the man’s torso leans forward. Giacometti's creation of this sculpture at the end of the 1940s coincided with his production of other career-defining bronzes, all featuring his signature attenuated figures, either represented alone or in a group. In each case this image of psychological isolation represents Giacometti's most literal attempt to personify his own existential preoccupations in the years following the Second World War. And to the Existentialist philosophers themselves, this very image became the clear and undisputed signifier of the exasperating uncertainty

Sensuous oil portraits of men are extraordinarily rare in early 20th century art, and Van Dongen's Jeune Arabe ranks among the very best of them.  Although he made a career for himself depicting the women of the demi and beau monde, it is this searing oil of a North African man that exemplifies Van Dongen's reputation as the most successful portrait painter among the Fauves.  Semi-nude and posed with confident nonchalance, the swaggering youth in this picture was inspired by encounters the artist had on a trip to North Africa in the winter of 1910 (fig. 3).  The lessons learned from his time there transformed his art, resulting in a brand of raw sensuality that renewed and intensified the original shock value of Fauvism.
Van Dongen was not alone in

Painted around 1916-17 at the beginning of their relationship, Jeanne Hébuterne au collier is believed to be the very first portrait of Modigliani's future wife and muse, Jeanne Hébuterne.  The sheer excitement that the artist must have felt at this nascent stage in their love affair is evident in this beautiful picture.  The surface texture of the composition, rendered with generous dollops of paint, appears to be almost jewel-encrusted, especially when considering the sitter's sapphire-blue eyes.  At the bottom of the canvas the artist lavishes his cursive signature, which may have been incisedinto the think impasto with the blunt end of his brush.  If this picture was meant to impress his new paramour, one might imagine that it succeeded.   For the rest of Modigliani's life, Jeanne would be

Painted in 1885, Le Givre à Giverny depicts the hoar-frost covered trees at Giverny, a town on the outskirts of Paris that would become synonymous with the most innovative compositions of Monet's career. The artist moved with his family to Giverny in April 1883 and remained there for the rest of his life. The two silhouetted figures in the present work are the artist’s son and step-son Michel Monet and Jean-Pierre Hoschedé who are walking near the Ile de Orties in the village. The dynamic handling of paint represents Monet’s progression towards a more radicalised depiction of the natural world that would effectively establish him as a pillar of the avant-garde, as the dramatic interplay of light and shadow here transforms the landscape into a sensory montage of textures and colours.

Chagall found an endless amount of pleasure in depicting the visual splendor of the circus.  Throughout his career he drew great creative energy from watching the event, and some of his most important canvases are fantastic depictions that exaggerate the pageantry of the performance.  “It’s a magic world, the circus,” Chagall once wrote, “an age-old game that is danced, and in which tears and smiles, the play of arms and legs take the form of great art….The circus is the performance that seems to me the most tragic. Throughout the centuries, it has been man’s most piercing cry in his search for entertainment and joy.  It often takes the form of lofty poetry.  I seem to see a Don Quixote in search of an ideal, like that marvelous clown who wept and dreamed of human love.”

‘Insofar as possible I’d like to get beyond easel painting, which in my opinion pursues a petty aim’, Miró declared in 1938, a decade after he famously proclaimed that he wanted to ‘assassinate painting’. For the rest of his career he produced works that embody a paradox unique to his œuvre: whilst creating art that went against traditional notions of painting, he never ceased to be a painter and to see himself primarily as a painter. Later in life Miró explained: ‘Anti-painting was a revolt against a state of mind and traditional painting techniques that were later judged morally unjustifiable. It was also an attempt to express myself through new materials’ (quoted in Joan Miró: Painting and Anti-Painting, 1927-1937 (exhibition catalogue), The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2008-09, p. 1).

According to Pierre Daix, the present work is the first study for this world-renowned masterpiece and depicts the figure along the right side of the final composition (see fig. 1).  The preliminary sketches that Picasso completed for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon not only demonstrate various stages, processes and changes in the artist’s mind that led to the final work, but also constitute a vital body of experimental work that resulted in the invention of Analytic Cubism. Completed in the incipient stages of early Cubism, all of these studies deal with the subject of the female nude, some concentrating on single

This is one of the most important Flemish Baroque self portraits and perhaps the finest still remaining in private hands. Painted in England in 1640, it presents a powerful image of the artist who so successfully immortalised the social elegance and aristocratic sophistication of King Charles I and his court. Infused with character and charisma it was painted at the height of van Dyck's career - with the utmost bravado and confidence; each sweep of the paint brush breathtakingly effective despite its deceptive simplicity. Van Dyck portrays himself dressed in a rich black and white silk doublet his body leaning intimately against the picture plane and towards the viewer. His intense gaze attracts and holds our attention.
A highlight of the recent Van Dyck & Britain exhibition, this portrait epitomises the elegant poise and relaxed informality that the artist

Painted in 1963, Le Peintre et son modèle exemplifies the dynamic force of Picasso’s late work on a magnificent scale. Picasso presents a panegyric to the powerful relationship between artist and model. The male figure, a recognizable amalgamation of self portraiture, paints a female nude reminiscent of the women painted by Rubens, Ingres and Goya (see figs. 1-3). With its foundation in this trajectory of art history, Le Peintre et son modèle is a monumental and dynamic depiction of this historic theme.
Throughout the spring of 1963, Picasso executed a series of paintings on the theme of the painter and his model, one of the great recurring motifs of his late work. “Picasso painted, drew and etched this subject so many times in his life that, as Michel Leiris has remarked, it almost became a genre in itself like landscape or still-life.

Picasso's dynamic, three-dimensional rendering of Sylvette is among his most powerful interpretations of the human face.  Using bent sheet metal onto which he has painted the girl's features, he created a wildly imaginative likeness of a young woman with her blonde ponytail and blue-striped sailor's shirt.  This highly detailed sculpture features two simultaneous interpretations of the woman's face which can be seen when viewed in the round.  Of the four metal sculptures of Sylvette, the present work is perhaps Picasso's most complex work devoted to his elusive model. 

19-year-old Sylvette David was Picasso's neighbor in Vallauris who had caught his eye from afar during the spring

A late 19th or early 20th century copy after the painting which depicts Venus attempting to prevent Adonis from hunting, in the Uffizi, Florence, datable to 'circa' 1640–50. The painting was formerly attributed to Rubens (as the inscription on the back of the present canvas testifies) but has since been attributed to his pupil, Frans Wouters.1
Wouters entered Rubens' studio in 1634 and also came to England to work on commissions for Charles I in 1637. This composition reflects Wouters' debt to Rubens, as well as to Jan Brueghel the Elder, with whom Rubens often collaborated. The two dogs, lower left, for example, recur in several works by Jan Brueghel, including the painting executed in collaboration with Hendrick van Balen recently sold at Sotheby's in July.2 It must be assumed that Wouters also encountered this motif while working in Rubens' studio.
Julie von Bredow Gamboni was the daughter of Otto von Bismarck's relative, Leopold Waldemar von Bredow. She married Ferdinand Gamboni, a headmaster, and they lived in the celebrated Villa Mercedes on Capri. Her copy of Titian's 'Portrait of Caterina Cornaro', the original of which is also in the Uffizi, is in the Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia, Cyprus.

Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.
Basquiat’s burgeoning stardom reached a climax in 1982, the year after Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) was created. The artist spent 1982 jet-setting around the world, appearing at major exhibitions, as each

Monet’s dazzling view of the south coast of France, Antibes, vue du plateau Notre-Dame, is one of his most vibrant and brilliantly hued compositions of the 1880s. The azure sky is marked by a few scudding clouds and the landscape below is concocted from a rich palette of pink, turquoise and purple. Monet left Paris for the Côte d'Azur on 12th January 1888, arriving several days later. On the recommendation of Guy de Maupassant he planned to stay at the Chateau de la Pinède, a hotel popular with artists. As was often the case, Monet did not find the company of his fellow guests very congenial and in this instance he found the group of artists who gathered around about the Barbizon painter Henri Harpignies particularly irritating. Monet contented himself by first exploring the area around Antibes, Agay and Trayas to the west, then moving towards Monte Carlo in

Symbolic of victory in Europe, Picasso's paintings of a tomato plant in bloom are considered some of the most important works that he produced during the war years. Although his work of this period tended to avoid direct references to the war, these pictures are imbued with both personal and cultural significance.

In the summer of 1944, when the Allied forces began to advance towards Paris and the end of Nazi Occupation was in sight, Picasso could not help but to be embroiled in current events. For the first time since completing his epic Guernica in 1937, he made direct references in his pictures to life in Europe during the war.  While staying with Marie-Thérèse and their daughter Maya at the Boulevard Henri IV in the weeks before the Liberation of Paris, Picasso took notice of

In August 1946 the New York dealer Pierre Matisse wrote in a letter to Miró: ‘I need more than ever those canvases in order to complete your exhibition, which I want to do as soon as possible’ (quoted in Pierre Matisse and his Artists (exhibition catalogue), The Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, 2002, p. 209, translated from French). Among these canvases was a group of five large-scale oils, including the present work, which Miró had executed between the end of January and late February 1945. Matisse was keen to demonstrate to the American public the lively state of painting in Europe in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, and probably deemed this group of large oils to be among the most energetic and life-affirming works coming from Europe. Femme rêvant de l’évasion is the only work from this exceptional group of paintings still in private hands, as the

Portraiture has been a consistent theme throughout Richter's career and painting has forever been his primary medium of expression.  In a career devoted to exploring the potential of this medium, Richter has suspended the conventional opposition between figurative and abstract modes to express the endless possibilities of painting as the conveyor of truths about how the viewer acknowledges the world.  Matrosen (Sailors), from 1966 acutely demonstrates the artist's interest in the dichotomy between how the world is and how it is perceived – challenging the representational nature of painting.  Richter's gray-tone canvases of the 1960s are sourced from, and intimately connected to photographs.  Using images from advertisements, magazines, newspapers and his own amateur photography, Richter explored a vast range of subject matter including people, objects, cityscapes

The subject of women reading was one that had absorbed Renoir since the 1870s.  In 1872 he painted Madame Claude Monet Lisant (Daulte 73, Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Massachusets) and in 1874 the celebrated La Liseuse (Daulte 106, Musée d'Orsay, Paris).
Part of the great appeal of the subject for Renoir was the challenge to capture a model utterly engaged in another activity and therefore naturally posed rather than in a deliberate posture.  The subject also provoked Renoir's deep sense of artistic tradition.  John House noted that, “Pictures of girls reading had been common at least since the eighteenth century” (John House in Renoir, The Hayward Gallery and travelling, 1985, p. 225).  Renoir may have known paintings such as Fragonard's L'Etude (The Louvre, Paris) which portrays a woman with a book.

Introduction.
This sensational picture is one of the great works of eighteenth century English animal painting. Indeed, in many ways, it is one of the great lost works from any age in British Art. Lost, for although it was one of the artist’s most celebrated works during his lifetime, and has been known through innumerable prints (which are taken from a later version of the composition, see fig.2), it has only been exhibited four times since it was painted. Having spent the whole of the nineteenth century virtually unseen, it was exhibited only twice in the twentieth, once in a small dealer’s exhibition, shortly after it had been bought by the present owners, in 1963; and again when it featured in the major retrospective of Stubbs’s work at the Tate Gallery in London, and the Yale Centre for British Art in New Haven. It then again lay dormant

Miró's sculpture assemblages are among his most inventive works of art. These creations draw upon the artist's radical experimentations as a Surrealist in the 1930s, and also address issues of abstraction, figuration and conceptualism that were central concerns of artists working in post-war Europe and the United States. Repurposing utilitarian objects like forks, pipes and wire, the artist would devise fanciful artistic creations that allowed him to reinterpret the world around him. The present sculpture of a rooster is a brilliant example of Miró's artistic alchemy.This bronze was executed from a ceramic version of Le Coq, made by the artist in 1956. It was around this time that Miró's fellow Spaniard Picasso was equally fowl-minded in his approach to sculptural assemblages, creating his famous La Grue (see fig. 1) from similiar 'found' objects from his studio.

La Place, Giacometti's first multi-figural sculpture, is one of the most powerful representations of psychological isolation and vulnerability.  Reconciling the quiet life of the mind with the cacophony of urban existence was of central concern to the Existentialist movement in post-war France, and Giacometti was at the forefront in his investigation of this dilemma.  In the years after the war Giacometti became fascinated by spatial relationships and the concept of movement within a single work.  He began to create sculptures that employed multiple figures on a common base, all existing as independent entities during a moment in time.  Without question, La Place is the most provocative of Giacometti's sculptural interpretations of this concept and was the font of inspiration that he would draw

Resplendant with the glimmer and frosty sheen of snow and ice, L'Entrée de Giverny en hiver, painted in 1885, depicts the trodden road leading into Giverny, the town on the outskirts of Paris that would become synonymous with the most innovative compositions of the artist's career. Monet moved with his family to Giverny in April 1883 and remained there for the rest of his life. By 1890, he had become financially successful enough to buy a house and a large garden, which provided the site for his legendary Nymphéas compositions at the turn of the century.  In the present work, we can see the artist leaning towards a more radicalised depiction of the natural world that would effectively establish him as a pillar of the avant-garde, as the dramatic interplay of light and shadow here transforms

Les Trois acrobates is one of Chagall's earliest interpretations of a theme that would come to dominate his career. Chagall's fascination with the circus dates back to his early trips to Paris, where he often visited the well-known Cirque Médrano, located in the 11th arrondissement on the edge of Montmartre, and the Cirque d’hiver. Chagall drew creative energy from watching the performances, infatuated by the pageantry. According to Franz Meyer, Les Trois acrobates is the first recorded work where Chagall addressed this seminal subject, and he returned to this composition in a significant oil painting of 1926. 
Lionello Venturi explained of the significance of this subject to the artist, ""The importance of the circus motif in modern French literature and painting is well known; in painting it suffices to recall the names of Seurat

Gerhard Richter's contribution to the theory and practice of painting in the second half of the Twentieth Century marks him as one of the most influential artists of his time. Arguably, more than any other artist, Richter has developed the art of painting; blurring the boundaries between form and content, between Sign and Signifier, on the canvas. Richter's concern was not so much how to make marks, but why one should develop such marks in the context of an antagonism between representation and re-representation. The only reality was not the image, but the process. For Richter, painting became an ethereal exploration, with the canvas as the laboratory; his tools thus became the means to conjure some of the most magical images of this period.
This intellectual and painterly elasticity was born from the radical developments of his monochromatic Photo-Paintings in the 1960s.

A remarkable example of Magritte’s mature painting, Le beau monde unites some of the best known elements of the artist’s iconography: the curtain, the apple and the sky, all depicted in a setting that is at once interior and exterior. The canvas is dominated by three monumental curtains, with an apple in front of them. Marking a recession towards the depth of the composition, these elements are placed on an unidentified plane, which could represent a stage set or a corner of a room. Through the use of curtains Magritte presents a juxtaposition of opposites – the paradox of concealing and revealing, and the contrast between the natural and the man-made, between interior and exterior settings. By confronting these contrasted elements, the artist evokes the essential surrealist paradigm of questioning the significance and purpose we attribute to various objects, and creating new meanings

Prométhée exemplifies the unique sculptural language Constantin Brancusi developed in the early years of the twentieth century. The work displays an unprecedented stylization of form in which the artist re-established his own artistic idiom. After arriving in Paris from Bucharest in 1904, Brancusi proceeded to revolutionize the boundaries of sculptural form. He created a sophisticated minimalism that combined influences ranging from primitive models to Romanian folk traditions and the sleek machine aesthetic of the industrial age. Brancusi took form to the brink of abstraction while relying upon the romantic power of representation.
Brancusi arrived at the radical simplification of form in Prométhée through a series of ovoid works that he began in 1908 with L'enfant endormie. This work in marble

Few works by Egon Schiele are as psychologically penetrating, autobiographically revealing or as exquisitely executed as Liebespaar (Selbstdarstellung mit Wally). The subject of self-portraiture enthralled the artist, and by the time the present work was created Schiele was engaged in producing what is now arguably the most celebrated stream of self-imagery of the 20th century. The most potent of these works conflated his key artistic concerns with personal crises, expressed in highly innovative compositional arrangements and strikingly bold execution. In this transfixing double portrait, Schiele expresses the emotional turmoil involved in the ending of his relationship with his lover Walpurga (Wally) Neuzil (fig. 1). This lavishly coloured sheet epitomises the method in which Schiele would commit his most confidential thoughts to paper in a boldly confrontational manner, transfiguring

Landscapes were rarely depicted by the Cubists, but in this composition Léger transforms this view of the French countryside into a spectacle of remarkable depth and formal complexity.   The picture dates from 1914, when France was on the verge of war, and it would be one of the last canvases that Léger would complete before being conscripted later that year.  The subject of the French landscape, therefore, had a special significance in that it was a reminder of what would soon become a battleground.  What Léger is depicting here, and in a select group of other landscapes that he completed during this time (see fig. 1), is the very thing that the nation was defending.  The result is a work of extraordinary freshness and power that captures the dynamism and essential beauty inherent

Mark Rothko is among the pantheon of artists whose ability to evoke universal truths through painting has fundamentally shifted our visual culture. Gifted by the artist to the Weisman family in a gesture of friendship and remaining in the family since then, Untitled (Nude) and Untitled (Underwater Series) embody two crucial stages in the artist’s creative growth, acting as pivotal exemplars in the development of Rothko’s voice in New York’s mid-century artistic firmament. Rothko met the late Jesse Weisman in the 1930s and the two became trusted friends, sharing summer rental houses in Mahopac, NY on their family vacations with their wives and children. As Jesse’s daughter, Susan Weisman McGee, recalls, “when my brother, Peter, was young and the Rothkos would come over to visit, Mark would sit Peter on his lap and draw pictures of cowboys and Indians.”

Numerous art curators and critics such as Johnson Chang and Li Xianting have especially praised the brilliant reinvention of Western stylistic techniques and intellectual observation of the Chinese society in the series to be a distinctive factor that sets Zhang apart from other artists of his time. Created in 1996, Bloodline: Big Family No. 13 (Lot 1046) pictures a mother and her son. While continuing the examination of history and Chinese ethical relationships of the larger Bloodline: Big

Monet’s sweeping view of a wheat field beneath a sky of cirrus clouds is among the classic Impressionist landscapes from the early 1880s.   The picture dates from 1881, when the artist was living in Vétheuil, and depicts a wheat field in Lavacourt, just across the river.  Its apparent simplicity notwithstanding, Champ de blé is in fact masterfully nuanced in both composition and surface treatment.   Monet’s pictures of these months were customarily consigned to Durand-Ruel and sold shortly thereafter, as was the case for the related composition, Champ de coquelicots (W. 677, Museum Boymans van Beuningen, Rotterdam).  Champ de blé, however, was probably the picture that Monet included in the seventh Impressionist exhibition in 1882, which was the last time the artist would exhibit with the original group.

Monet and his wife Alice traveled to Venice for the first time in the autumn of 1908 at the invitation of Mary Young Hunter, a wealthy American who had been introduced to the Monets by John Singer Sargent. They arrived on October 1 and spent two weeks as her guest at the Palazzo Barbaro before moving to the Grand Hotel Britannia on the Grand Canal where they stayed until their departure on December 7. Initially reluctant to leave his house and garden at Giverny, Monet must have sensed that the architectural splendors of Venice in their watery environment would present new and formidable challenges. His first days in Venice seemed only to confirm his initial fears but after several days of his customary discouragement, he commenced work on October 7. In his study of Monet's work and the Mediterranean, Joachim Pissarro has given a detailed account of Monet's working schedule while he was

Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.
Basquiat’s burgeoning stardom reached a climax in 1982, the year after Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) was created. The artist spent 1982 jet-setting around the world, appearing at major exhibitions, as each

In 1913, he held at his gallery the largest and most comprehensive exhibition of Picasso’s works that had yet been seen. The show was a huge success and formed the beginning of a close personal and professional relationship between dealer and artist. Over the years Thannhauser acquired many more works by Picasso, including Woman Ironing (1904), now in the collection of the Solomon Guggenheim Museum.

""Like most of Mitchell's art since the early 1960s, these pastels are informed, but not representationally formed, by nature. They give body to memories of deep visual and emotional sensations cued by her responses to nature. More often than not, her variegated strokes of unbroken color and energy reflect, in some way, the light and vegetation of her garden in Vétheuil, with its view of the Seine and the surrounding fields. But they might occasionally call to the more sizzling clarities of Cézanne's Provence or to the landscape of Mitchell's childhood.""

Perhaps the most celebrated sculpture of all time, Rodin's Penseur  was conceived in 1880-81 to crown his monumental Gates of Hell.  The figure was first intended to represent Dante, surrounded by the characters of his Divine Comedy, but soon took on an independent life. ""Thin and ascetic in his straight gown"", Rodin wrote later, ""my Dante would have been meaningless once divorced from the overall work. Guided by my initial inspiration, I conceived another ""thinker"", a nude, crouching on a rock, his feet tense. Fists tucked under his chin, he muses. Fertile thoughts grow slowly in his mind. He is no longer a dreamer. He is a creator"" (quoted in R. Masson & V. Mattiussi, Rodin, Paris, 2004, p. 38). Transcending Dante's narrative, the Penseur became a universal symbol of reflection and creative genius which has ever since retained

Roy Lichtenstein's artistic career was marked by an unprecedented ability to unlock the beauty from the pictorial conventions of ubiquitous, everyday images.  In the 1960s, Lichtenstein garnered fame for his adaptations of comics, advertising and other forms of 'low' art, placing them into the 'high' art context of the gallery and museum.  These paintings reproduce the language of graphic and commercial reproductions. Yet with bold lines and vivid color, Lichtenstein created a unique style which was the beginning of his ultimate subject: art about art.  Avant-garde and Modernist movements earlier in the century had decried traditional genres such as nudes, landscapes and narrative painting. Yet as the century progressed, many artists acknowledged that the subject matter of figurative and landscape art never completely disappeared, and the dialectic between the subjects of

Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.
Basquiat’s burgeoning stardom reached a climax in 1982, the year after Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) was created. The artist spent 1982 jet-setting around the world, appearing at major exhibitions, as each

Seated on the ground with legs spread wide apart, the female figure in Nu accroupi has many ancestors in Picasso’s oeuvre. In Femme assise painted on March 5, 1940 (Zervos, vol. 10, no. 302; see fig. 1), the stress of the war is readily apparent in the distorted limbs and anguished gestures of the figure.  A later treatment of the same theme – Femme assise, painted on July 9, 1953 (Zervos, vol. 15, no. 292, see fig. 2) – is a splendid exercise in the faceted analysis of form that evolved from Cubism. By the time Picasso came to paint the present work, the nude had become one of his dominant themes.
As Klaus Gallwitz has observed: “Many factors coincide to precipitate the painter-model theme. Similarly, the female nudes, and later the portraits of the painter, again and again received new impulse from the great erotic tension between painter and model.  In

Portraying a young boy, only identified by his valet uniform, Le Valet de chambre epitomises Soutine's portraiture of the middle and late 1920s, characterised by a great expressiveness of pose, rhythmically charged brushstrokes and strong colour contrasts. Regardless of the age, social status, or the artist's personal involvement with the sitter, Soutine's portraits are imbued with a strong physical presence, as well as with a uniqueness and individuality of his subjects. As the authors of the Catalogue raisonné of Soutine's work have commented: 'While his portraits do convey inner realities and make spiritual statements, they are primarily rooted in concrete perception. Though Soutine may project his inner turbulence and most personal feelings onto his subjects, the viewer never loses sight of a particular physical entity being carefully observed and experienced.

One of the most innovative and celebrated draughtsmen of the nineteenth century, Georges Seurat created works on paper of ineffable beauty that are technically dazzling and emotionally compelling. Étude pour une baignade, Asnières is one of the finest and most artistically accomplished drawings by the artist and relates to one of his greatest paintings, Une baignade, Asnières of 1883-1884. Seurat first showed his Une baignade, Asnières in 1884 during the Salon des Indépendants in Paris, where it met with admiration and shock in equal measure. The painting’s luminous colours, applied in regulated dots of colour, evoke the hot, hazy atmosphere of a summer afternoon on the bank of the Seine in the Paris suburbs. For this monumental canvas Seurat realised numerous painstaking studies and drawings. Each figure in the composition was studied independently of the others

This is one of the finest examples of Jan Brueghel’s famous 'Paradise' landscapes to remain in private hands. Transcending the tiny dimensions of the copper panel upon which it was painted, its beautifully rendered panoramic woodland setting and the lovingly detailed depiction of the teeming variety of the animal life within it, makes it easy to see why such pictures became the most famous of all the artist’s works, earning him the sobriquet ‘Paradise Brueghel’. Within these exquisite works of art Brueghel managed to give expression not only to Counter Reformation religious thought on the Creation and the natural world, but also to the burgeoning contemporary interest in the classification and representation of all its many species. From his own day to this, such works have consistently remained the rarest and most prized of all his creations.

Devastatingly and irresistibly seductive, Brigitte Bardot gazes sultrily toward us, enrapturing the viewer with her screen vixen persona. With his bewitching 1974 portrait of the steamy bombshell blonde, Andy Warhol offered the magnetic essence of the siren who seduced the world, enticing us with her come-hither allure. Bardot’s blue visage lures with powerful hypnotic intensity, and yet as is archetypal of Warhol’s enduring conceptual project, all we are left with is her image frozen in the eternal moment of the camera’s flash. Belonging to the legendary series of eight works commissioned by Gunter Sachs, to whom Bardot was married from 1966-1969, Bardot's radiant sapphire visage stands as inevitable successor to the irresistible trinity of Liz Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, and Jackie Kennedy beatified by Warhol's immaculate silkscreen in the 1960s.

Kirchner's monumental Das Boskett: Albertplatz in Dresden is a highly sophisticated blend of Brücke boldness allied with cosmopolitan allure. Painted in 1911, the year in which Kirchner and the Brücke group moved from Dresden to Berlin,  the present work was one of the artist's last canvases to depict the topography of Dresden, the capital of Saxony where he came of age as an artist and as a man. The Albertplatz in Dresden was one of the epicentres for life and traffic in the heart of the city (fig. 1), on the north bank of the Elbe, and the railed, circular arrangement of plants, dominated by the exotic palm trees, forms the centre of the square and the focal point of Kirchner's composition.
The topography of Dresden and Berlin were crucial themes in the work of the Brücke artists. Deborah Wye writes

In July 1969 Picasso executed several large paintings on the theme of a musketeer holding a sword (fig. 1), of which the present work is a powerful example. One of the great subjects of the artist's late oeuvre, the musketeer was one of a cast of psychological avatars that were a means of projecting different aspects of his own identity. These portraits of the various archetypes (fig. 2) that populated Picasso's personal mythology were part of a late flowering, a final synthesis which merged the artist's personal history with the cultural heritage of the Western artistic tradition, and developed a direct and spontaneous style that celebrated the act of artistic creation. In choosing the iconography shared by Old Master painters such as Rembrandt (fig. 4) and Velázquez, Picasso was, at the end of his career, consciously aligning himself with the greatest artists of the Western

Giacomo Balla’s remarkable images of racing automobiles emerged in 1913 in the wake of the artist’s “rebirth” as a Futurist.  Although he had signed the “Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting” in April 1910, his work did not respond to the manifesto’s demand for paintings that focused on modern dynamism, the triumphs of technology, or sensations of speed until late in 1911.  Balla’s Street Lamp, a painting that figures the centrifugal radiance of an electric arc lamp as it overpowers the softer light of the moon, did not meet the expectations of fellow Futurists Umberto Boccioni and Carlo Carrà.

The present work was executed during Chagall’s second period in France, where he returned in 1923 and stayed until his move to the United States during the Second World War. 1939, when Le Violoncelliste was executed, was a momentous year in Chagall’s life: while his international reputation as a leading artist of the Ecole de Paris was rapidly growing – that year he received the Carnegie Prize – the threat of war forced him to leave Paris and take refuge in Saint-Dye-sur-Loire in the south of France, where he also hid some of his canvases. That year also marked an important shift in Chagall’s art; while he often used motifs developed in his earlier career, with the looming war on the horizon his works acquired a more symbolic, multi-layered character, and his canvases became more tightly composed and more densely coloured.
  During Chagall’s years in France, his subjects

The monumental Homme assis is a powerful example of a theme that was central to Picasso in the last years of his life. The work was painted during Picasso’s most prolific year, 1969, during which he seemed to not at all be effected by his advanced age but rather invigorated that he had more and more to paint.  These works were exhibited in a dedicated show the following year in 1970, organized by Christian Zervos, which opened at the Palais des Papes in Avignon.  This exhibition was one of two major exhibitions devoted to this time in the artist’s career and was the only one held during his life time. The large canvases were displayed one on top of another in the hall of Clement IV, taking full advantage of the Gothic venues's high vaulted ceilings.

'Still-life is the touchstone of the painter,' Manet concluded in the last years of his life, when his artistic attention was largely focused on the depiction of floral still-lifes. This resulted in a number of canvases, executed in the early 1880s, of a single vase of flowers on a marble surface, a motif that he used as an element in his grand composition, Le Bar aux Folies-Bergère (fig. 1). Manet's interest in still-lifes is well-noted throughout his career. He pronounced that  'a painter can say all he wants to with fruit or flowers' after seeing Renaissance examples in Venice in the 1860s, and he devoted one-fifth of his production to the genre alone. Even in Manet's most renowned figure paintings, the symbolic potential and importance of decorative objects was never far from his mind. Flowers, for example, play a powerful role in Olympia

There is no more revelatory or intimate a subject for an artist than a self-portrait.  This was especially true for Egon Schiele, whose unmatched skill as a draftsman could expose the intimate details and peculiarities of the body that would otherwise go unnoticed.  Because he was not dependant upon the cooperation of his models to translate his vision for these works, Schiele's self-portraits are often more revealing than even his most salacious pictures of nude women.  He was completely without restriction in portraying his own vulnerability, playfulness or absurdity, and this freedom of expression is undeniably apparent in this fantastic gouache from 1917.
In Selbstbildnis mit kariertem Hemd, Schiele rendered what would be regarded as one of his signature poses. His body is self-consciously mannered

Of the extraordinary works that Gauguin created in the South Pacific, it was his sculpture and carvings that the artist believed to be the most important of his creative vision.  Jeune tahitienne is an exceptional manifestation of Gauguin's accomplishments in this medium, and was carved during his first stay in Tahiti between 1890 and the summer of 1893.  A few months after returning to Paris, Gauguin gave this sculpture to Jeanne Fournier, the nine-year-old daughter of the critic and collector Jean Dolent, having promised to bring her a gift from the tropics.  In 1961, Fournier entrusted the sale of this work to Father Celas Rzewuski, a member of the Dominican Order, who consigned it to Sotheby's in London, where it was purchased by the present owner.  This is the first time that Jeune tahitienne has been on view

Pulsating with vibrant color and rich, painterly detail, Frau mit grünem Fächer exemplifies Jawlensky's talents as a key figure in Expressionism.  This exceptional composition dates from 1912, at the height of the artist's involvement with the Blaue Reiter, and is a distillation of the varied stylistic concerns that preoccupied the Russian ex-patriot and German avant-garde during the early 20th century.   Jawlensky would always return to the face as a means to explore the range of human emotion throughout his career.   Although we know that the model for the present work was Helene, the artist's wife, Jawlensky preferred anonymous titles for his works so that he could express objectively the power and impact of color.   ""[H]uman faces are for me only suggestions to see something else

“The photos I use aren’talways that interesting or distinguished. That’s deliberate – I like the fact they’re bland: they leave a lot of space for invention. Painting is about working your way across the surface, getting lost in it … It’s about the idea of getting absorbed into them, so you get physically lost.” (Peter Doig in Exhibition Catalogue, Berlin, Contemporary Fine Arts; London, Victoria Miro Gallery, Peter Doig: Blotter, 1995, p. 10)
  It is the monumental size and wall power of White Canoe which first draws you into its dream-like world. Its epic magical mystery contains a single white canoe glowing at its heart, floating serenely in the glassy moon-lit water, with a single figure bent over as if hiding. With a horizon line lying three quarters of the way up the painting, one is aware that the water is so still that most of the painting represents

Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.
Basquiat’s burgeoning stardom reached a climax in 1982, the year after Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) was created. The artist spent 1982 jet-setting around the world, appearing at major exhibitions, as each

Cashmere Shawl, painted in 1910, belongs to a series of highly celebrated works produced during John Singer Sargent’s summer sojourns in the Italian Alps.  Sargent’s subject, Dorothy Barnard, a close family friend and frequent traveling partner, is pictured swathed in a Turkish cashmere shawl reclining next to Nicola D’Inverno, the artist’s valet.  The paisley bordered shawl, which is featured in several paintings and watercolors of the period, evinces Sargent’s keen aesthetic interest in orientalism, a vogue popularized by a great number of European artists during the 19th century. 
  Sargent spent his holidays painting and traveling on the continent, often dividing his time between the Swiss Alps during the hot summer months and Italian cities such as Venice, Florence and Rome in the fall and by 1900, these summer interludes became

For Degas, the classrooms of the Paris Opéra Garnier functioned as his studio and mainstage for his depictions of the ballet. His practice ran parallel with the ballerinas’ rehearsals: as they laced their slippers, he sharpened his pencils; when they would dance, Degas would draw. He practiced and followed their movements with the very same precision and diligence with which the ballerinas executed their pliés and rond de jambes at the barre.
Danseuses à la barre is also emblematic of Degas’ continued interest in the Opéra’s stage and its spacious classrooms. In his drawing, Degas slants the floor plane on a diagonal and crops the ballerina by the frame while her limbs and gestures remain comfortably contained with the picture, absorbed in her craft. Without narrative, the viewer's focus is drawn directly to the dancers' movements and gestures. We thus find

To say an artist is deeply influenced by Cézanne today is a veritable cliché. Such was not the case after the master's memorial exhibition in 1907 at the Salon d’Automne in Paris, where over fifty canvases confronted viewers, and the artists among the viewers in turn confronted Cézanne (see fig. 1). It was at this exhibition that Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and André Derain fully embraced Cézanne’s lessons, particularly those found in his nude bathers. “The Cézanne in the Salon d’Automne exhibition,” relates John Richardson, “which left the most immediate mark on works by Picasso and his new friends, Derain and Braque, were two of the large, late Grandes baigneuses. In the course of the next six months, these three painters would vie with one another over Cézanne’s mantle. Matisse was no longer in the race. Cézanne’s death had to some extent released him from the master’s

Zao Wou-Ki’s resplendent, masterful triptych 15.01.82

“Zao Wou-Ki’s creative destiny belongs not only to him but is closely connected to the past millennia in the evolution of Chinese painting and art. The basic fact that works benefit from artists’ own experiences in no way weakens artists’ keen search for their own directions, but empowers them even more so in touching people’s hearts. Precisely for this reason, Chinese painting stagnated for more than a century, but that impasse looks to be drawing to an end. The long-awaited, genuine coexistence between China and the West now appears for the first time … perhaps, when critics collectively reminisce about that time in the middle of this century when the artist travelled from his distant home to settle in Paris, they would be correct in claiming this important juncture a miracle. Just as miraculously,

‘Insofar as possible I’d like to get beyond easel painting, which in my opinion pursues a petty aim’, Miró declared in 1938, a decade after he famously proclaimed that he wanted to ‘assassinate painting’. For the rest of his career he produced works that embody a paradox unique to his œuvre: whilst creating art that went against traditional notions of painting, he never ceased to be a painter and to see himself primarily as a painter. Later in life Miró explained: ‘Anti-painting was a revolt against a state of mind and traditional painting techniques that were later judged morally unjustifiable. It was also an attempt to express myself through new materials’ (quoted in Joan Miró: Painting and Anti-Painting, 1927-1937 (exhibition catalogue), The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2008-09, p. 1).

Painted six months before the breakdown of Picasso’s relationship with Françoise Gilot, Femme au chien provides a powerful commentary on this passionate and tumultuous time in the artist’s life. Picasso and Gilot first met in in 1943, while he was still entangled with an increasingly mentally fragile Dora Maar. By 1946 he and Gilot had settled in Vallauris and in the years that followed with the birth of their children Claude ad Paloma, Picasso was, probably more than at any other time, devoted to his family. The happiness of his private life spilled into his canvases, resulting in a number of portraits of Gilot and their children.
Over the years Picasso's depictions of Françoise became increasingly stylized, from painting her as a ""Woman-flower"" to those that essentialize her image. Having left behind the innocent, dream-like portraits of Marie-Thérèse Walter, as well as

In The Attended, Brice Marden exhibits a freedom of sinuous line and organic form that benefits from the rhythmic inspiration of Asian calligraphy which gave birth to his radical Cold Mountain series of 1985-1991, but goes beyond those columnar figurations and tautly braided compositions to achieve a newly triumphant sense of clarity and forcefulness. Marden is not hesitant to title his works, enabling for rich interpretations on the part of the viewer. In one sense, Marden’s title for The Attended and the other five paintings in his Attendant series can refer to Chinese pottery figures placed in tombs to accompany the inhabitants on their journey to the afterlife. In another sense, the Attendant series can also be an adjective alluding to concomitant associations or consequences, as noted by Harry Cooper in his essay for the catalogue of the Serpentine

The monumental Mousquetaire. Buste of 1968 belongs to a major series of paintings that Picasso executed on the theme of the musketeer, which became one of the key subjects of his late œuvre. In October and November of that year Picasso painted a number of musketeers, almost all of them depicted with a pipe (fig. 1). The image of the musketeer allowed Picasso to escape the limitations of contemporary subject matter and explore the spirit of a past age. These characters embodied the courtly mannerisms of the Renaissance gentleman and signified the golden age of painting, reflecting the influence of Rembrandt on Picasso's art. Picasso had devoted a large portion of his time and passion throughout the 1960s to the reinterpretation and investigation of the old masters, an experience in which he reaffirmed his connection to some of the greatest painters in the history of art.

Munch began working on Summer Day in 1903, as part of a major commission by Dr Max Linde, for his children’s nursery room at their family home at Lübeck. Linde (1862-1940) was an ophthalmologist and one of Munch’s devoted patrons. The artist first met Linde in 1902, and later that year was commissioned to produce graphic work for the Linde Portfolio of etchings of his house and garden and the members of his family. In 1903 Linde published a book Edvard Munch und die Kunst der Zukunft and, alongside Gustav Schiefler, was to become the artist’s main supporter in Germany. Munch enjoyed his stays at Linde’s house, which he visited on several occasions, and on 14th December 1904 he wrote to his aunt: ‘Here in Lübeck I live very well quietly working, no Norwegians – I have painted a large self-portrait, and I think I could do a lot of painting here – Dr Linde’s

Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.

For Degas, the classrooms of the Paris Opéra Garnier functioned as his studio and mainstage for his depictions of the ballet. His practice ran parallel with the ballerinas’ rehearsals: as they laced their slippers, he sharpened his pencils; when they would dance, Degas would draw. He practiced and followed their movements with the very same precision and diligence with which the ballerinas executed their pliés and rond de jambes at the barre.
Danseuses à la barre is also emblematic of Degas’ continued interest in the Opéra’s stage and its spacious classrooms. In his drawing, Degas slants the floor plane on a diagonal and crops the ballerina by the frame while her limbs and gestures remain comfortably contained with the picture, absorbed in her craft. Without narrative, the viewer's focus is drawn directly to the dancers' movements and gestures. We thus find

Painted in 1963, Le Peintre et son modèle exemplifies the dynamic force of Picasso’s late work on a magnificent scale. Picasso presents a panegyric to the powerful relationship between artist and model. The male figure, a recognizable amalgamation of self portraiture, paints a female nude reminiscent of the women painted by Rubens, Ingres and Goya (see figs. 1-3). With its foundation in this trajectory of art history, Le Peintre et son modèle is a monumental and dynamic depiction of this historic theme.
Throughout the spring of 1963, Picasso executed a series of paintings on the theme of the painter and his model, one of the great recurring motifs of his late work. “Picasso painted, drew and etched this subject so many times in his life that, as Michel Leiris has remarked, it almost became a genre in itself like landscape or still-life.

Announcing one of the most indisputably iconic images of Pop Art on a quite astounding scale, Andy Warhol's immense Ten-Foot Flowers of 1967 utterly consumes our field of vision and is the artist's monumental realization of a conceptually infinite art. Composed upon a canvas nearly one hundred square feet in size, this painting was conceived specifically for his first retrospective exhibition in Europe and was always intended for a setting of museum eminence. Thus it is no surprise that today other works of the cycle are held in the most prestigious institution collections.

INTRODUCTION TO 'POPE'S VILLA AT TWICKENHAM'
On leaving the exhibition of this painting at Turner's Gallery in 1808, Sir Thomas Lawrence acknowledged that Turner was 'indisputedly the first landscape painter in Europe.'1

The painting clearly stood out above all the other exhibits and was extolled in the highest possible manner; 'the painter has chosen to represent, and has represented with unprecedented success, the poetic hour of pensive feeling on a tranquil autumnal evening. We scarcely remember any picture that more powerfully imparts its prevailing tone of tranquillity.'2 The praise could not have been more moving and remains as apt and appropriate today.

This is a painting which held deeply personal significance to Turner. It represented his need for escapism and tranquillity at this time, his passion for this area of the Thames so near to where

Mark Rothko is among the pantheon of artists whose ability to evoke universal truths through painting has fundamentally shifted our visual culture. Gifted by the artist to the Weisman family in a gesture of friendship and remaining in the family since then, Untitled (Nude) and Untitled (Underwater Series) embody two crucial stages in the artist’s creative growth, acting as pivotal exemplars in the development of Rothko’s voice in New York’s mid-century artistic firmament. Rothko met the late Jesse Weisman in the 1930s and the two became trusted friends, sharing summer rental houses in Mahopac, NY on their family vacations with their wives and children. As Jesse’s daughter, Susan Weisman McGee, recalls, “when my brother, Peter, was young and the Rothkos would come over to visit, Mark would sit Peter on his lap and draw pictures of cowboys and Indians.”

""I am interested in assembling a situation resembling painting, rather than painting."" –Tom Wesselmann
Great American Nude No. 48 is prototypical and seminal Pop art. Combining classical odalisque imagery and the contemporary artifice of popular culture, Wesselmann's Great American Nude series is an iconic paradigm of assemblage art. Contrary to easel painting or carved sculpture, where individual gesture or imagery function in relation to a representational or abstract whole, an assemblage is composed of heterogeneous elements whose significance is particular to the artist or the viewer. (Nicolas Calas, Icons and Images from the Sixties, New York, 1971, p. 21) Traceable to Cubist and Dadaist collages, and to such famed works as Marcel Duchamp's Bicycle Wheel (1913), assemblage elements retain autonomy from their structural functionality.

Ritmo astratto di Madame M.S., painted in Paris in 1915, is an exceptional and highly important Futurist portrait by Gino Severini. The artist first treated this subject in 1912 and produced a number of studies in pastel between the first version executed in oil (fig. 1) and the present work. The variations on the theme of Madame M.S. represent the finest and most complete exploration of portraiture within the artist's œuvre. The dynamic reconfiguration of the sitter’s features in the present work exemplifies the innovative, futo-cubist style Severini pioneered in the early 1910s. Although the Futurists executed only a few portraits, both Severini and Boccioni considered them to be an important part of their work (fig. 2). The portrait enabled the artists to explore further the deconstruction of form and animation which formed the basis for their work; as Severini explained:

Le Fumeur, painted in 1953, is considered by many to be a veiled self-portrait of Picasso.  In countless photographs from this era the artist was pictured wearing his striped sailor's shirt or smoking a cigarette (see fig. 1), and the references to those two favorite accessories in this picture are clear clues to the identity of the sitter. Most of Picasso's unspecified depictions of men at this moment in his career were depictions of himself.  By the 1950s, Picasso had reached a celebrity status that few artists of his generation would ever achieve.   But along with the great admiration of the art world came Picasso's own anxiety about growing old and his bitter feuds with Françoise Gilot, the mother of his two children, who had grown intolerant of the artist's deified persona.

Willem de Kooning’s paintings from 1977 have long been regarded as among the finest within his extensive oeuvre.  Prized for capturing the essence of the sea, the sand and the surf, the works from this pinnacle year are among de Kooning’s most dynamically expressive representations of nature and the Long Island landscape he loved.  De Kooning began spending summers in East Hampton in 1959 and frequently considered giving up his Broadway loft entirely, following the lead of his contemporaries Jackson Pollock and Arshile Gorky who had already escaped the urban commotion of Manhattan in favor of the countryside. By summer 1961, de Kooning had purchased a small house in Springs, East Hampton and the following winter, had found a piece of property nearby that was perfect for a studio.  In 1963 he had moved entirely out of New York and immersed himself in the light-filled,

Degas' studies of ballet dancers in various stages of preparation and performance is one of the most iconic genres of Impressionist art. In addition to being a comprehensive exploration of an activity that challenged the possibilities of physical movement and artistry of the human body, these studies, primarily done with pastel, are also a window into Parisian society at the end of the nineteenth century and a deeply psychological examination of performers who entertained the social elite. In the present work, Degas focuses his attention on one dancer, who is diligently stretching backstage prior to a performance. Engaged in her craft, she looks away from the viewer. Her body, graceful and lithe, is rendered with refined sensitivity, the curves of her body and the form of her limbs taking shape through Degas' adroit manipulation of color and line in the pastel medium.

Krass und Mild (Dramatic and Mild)¸ painted during Kandinsky's final months at the Bauhaus, is a visual symphony of geometry and color.  The composition explores the dimensionality of space by layering transparent color bands on top of opaque black forms to create an illusion of depth.  It is also a superb example of the artist's mature style, with its emphasis on individual shapes and their harmonious placement within a composition.  Kandinsky believed that particular arrangements of shapes triggered an ""inner resonance"" or ""spiritual vibration,"" and could elicit from a viewer a powerful emotional response.  Jagged solid forms, arcs, grids, triangles and circles, whether overlapping or adjacent, were strictly non-representational and created only to celebrate the beauty of form for form's sake.

Couple, le baiser is one of Picasso's boldest interpretations of the theme of lovers in a passionate embrace, representing a culmination of his exploration of this subject that preoccupied him between October and December 1969. Precedents for Picasso's treatment of this motif can be found within the artist's early œuvre, however the sense of immediacy and urgency evoked by his paintings from the late 1960s and early 1970s is unparalleled. In this series, Picasso alternated between the portrait and landscape formats, and variously focused on heads, busts or full-length representations of the figures, experimenting with the different formal arrangements of his characters. His creative output at this time was remarkable and this series of paintings illustrates the breathtaking flood of invention and fantastic vitality that characterised

The landscapes of Cézanne's mature period (1885-1894) are among the most celebrated of his production.  Environs de Gardanne, which the artist began in 1885 and probably finished in 1892, dates from the height of this important era and is an example of the stylistic traits that have come to define the artist's best work.  In these pictures, Cézanne focuses on the geometric schema of the landscape rather than on the individual details of nature or the architecture.   He applies his paint to the canvas in thin washes of color, which is a stark contrast to the thickly painted canvases from the prior decade.  Cézanne's concern by 1885 and onward rests mainly with the representation of form; extraneous details of composition are eliminated from these canvases.  The resulting landscapes are geometric assemblages of architecture and fieldscapes, rendered with

The medium of sculpture allowed Matisse a control over his subjects that he could not have in his paintings. The tactile experience of molding the clay with his hands enabled him to feel the form as he created it and to appreciate the sensuality of the figure in the round. Nu couché à la chemise was conceived in 1906, in the height of Matisse's Fauve period. In lieu of the wild coloration that emboldened his oils from these years, the expressive power of this work derives from the gestures of the limbs that the artist has pinched, twisted and stretched into place. Other casts of this work can be found in the Musée Matisse in Nice, the Baltimore Museum of Art and in the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C.

A legend from Montparnasse and a 1950s classic

In the early 20th-century, modernism became the holy grail in Paris — the art capital of the world — from the heights of Montmartre to Montparnasse. The Parisian author Henri-Pierre Roché introduced audiences to modernist maestros of different ethnicities and nationalities, notably Pablo Picasso, Constantin Brancusi and Marcel Duchamp, who came from Spain, Romania and France respectively. Also included on Roché's list of sure-fire hit artists was Sanyu, a Chinese icon and first-generation Chinese-French painter. Given his excellence in the field of Chinese art, Sanyu is definitely

This work has been requested for the upcoming exhibition, The Light of Venice, to be held at the Beyeler Foundation in Riehen from September 28, 2008 until January 25, 2009.
On his arrival in Venice in October 1908, Monet joined a long and illustrious list of artists captivated by the Serenissima. Like Whistler, Turner and Sargent before him, he was fascinated by Venice's soft flickering light and majestic architecture.  At first he felt that Venice was too beautiful to be painted, but in a matter of weeks he set up his easel along the Grand Canal and completed a series of beautifully atmospheric depictions of the lagoon.  The present painting is one of four works (see figs. 1 & 2) in which Monet depicted the 15th century palace of Giovanni Dario, the secretary of the Venetian senate.  This particular canvas one stands out among them all

The vibrant Buste d’homme lauré is a powerful example of a theme that was central to Picasso in the last years of his life. The work was painted during Picasso’s most prolific year, 1969, during which he seemed to not at all be affected by his advanced age but rather invigorated that he had more and more to paint.  These works were exhibited in a dedicated show the following year in 1970, organized by Christian Zervos, which opened at the Palais des Papes in Avignon.  This exhibition was one of two major exhibitions devoted to this time in the artist’s career and was the only one held during his life time. The large canvases were displayed one on top of another in the hall of Clement IV, taking full advantage of the high-vaulted ceilings in the Gothic venue.
Picasso’s objective to paint ‘nature’ is in direct opposition to the abstraction and minimalism

Painted in April 1939, Bridle Path, set in Central Park, masterfully captures Edward Hopper's fascination with the mystery and excitement of New York City. As was typical of Hopper's working method, he made several detailed pencil sketches (Fig. 1) on location, which later served as the basis for the final oil. Jo, Hopper's wife, described the work in her diary, ""[Edward] home in peace-made 2 fine sketches of new canvas. Bridle path in Central Park with the city outside-riders on the path. I'm most excited over this new picture-sure it will be outstandingly fine"" (Gail Levin, Edward Hopper, A Catalogue Raisonné, vol III, 1995, p. 262). The ambiguity of the narrative in Hopper's paintings, Bridal Path included, spark the imagination and provoke an endless interpretation of the composition and its meaning.

In 1958, Zao Wou-Ki entered into an irreversible new stage of artistic production. During this period, he believed that he no longer needed to create symbols in his paintings, and put aside his artistic achievements with the previous Oracle Bone Series. He believed that although symbols acted as a guide for paintings, they also caused restrictions. He therefore worked to try and achieve a breakthrough. He tried to express his inner feelings merely through lines and colours and to depict the invisible vital essence of the universe and nature. During this period, he abandoned the round brush he often used in the early 1950s, and switched to a flat brush, a broad brush and painting knife. His style became more enthusiastic and confident, and his colours, more robust. He played with light, colours and lines, blending

Natalia Sergeevna Goncharova,Espagnole,02.02.2010,"10,239,278","Goncharova constantly revisited the theme of Espagnole or Spanish Dancer throughout the 1920's and 30's.  A trip to Spain in 1916, at the request of Sergei Diaghilev, first acquainted her with the distinctive traditional dress of Spanish dancers.  During this visit she worked on costume designs for two ballets on a Spanish theme: Spanish Rhapsody, to music by Maurice Ravel, and Triana.  Neither ballet was performed, but her sketches sparked a life-long love of the subject, repeated in many differenet styles and media, from lithographs to ambitious oil compositions.
It is possible that Goncharova saw something 'Russian' in the Spanish dress.  Lace mantilla, pulled high over the head, seem to echo the form of a kokoshnik worn by Russian brides; and the long floral scarves hugging the body, recall those worn by Russian peasant

To his artistic peers and to subsequent generations of artists, Philip Guston was a painter's painter. He epitomized the Modernist paradigm that questioned the formulaic boundaries of painting and was in the artistic vanguard at two critical junctures in American 20th century art. Guston preferred to grapple with the questions on the nature of Art and to pursue one's own individual style of image-making. His continuous challenge of established tenets led Guston to play a crucial role in two transformative stylistic developments in American contemporary art that at first appear to be diametrically opposed: the abstract expressionist movement of the late 1940s and 1950s, and the renaissance of figuration in the ``New Image'' painting of the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Beggar's Joys is a masterpiece from his first major innovative transition in which he moved away

In a letter of 15 April 1707, the Leiden painter Adriaen van de Werff wrote to Richard, the son and biographer of Hendrick ter Brugghen, a letter praising his father and his works: ""...doch ik hebbe het geluk, dat ik nog dagelyx bij mijn goede vrienden van syn E(dele) beste werken kan sien en daermit hebbe geordeelt, gelijk ik nog doe, hoe grooten man UED. heer vader in onse konsten is geweest.

Espagnole is one of the finest portraits from Matisse's Nice period of the 1920s, when his skills as a colorist were at their most expressive.   This is one of his more intimate compositions that allows for a close engagement with the lovely young model, who is dressed in the exotic costume of a Spanish lady.   Matisse's best pictures of this period focused on ""the harmonious, light-filled, and often profusely decorated interiors, with languorous and seductive models"" (John Elderfield, ""The Early Years at Nice,"" Henri Matisse: A Retrospective (exhibition catalogue), The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1992, p. 289).  This splendidly painted work is a product of that rich artistic vocabulary and is a rare portrayal of one of those ""seductive"" models at close range.

The present sculpture is number eight in Giacometti's celebrated series of nine standing figures of a female nude, collectively known as the Femmes de Venise.  The series originates from a group of ten plasters which Giacometti had produced between January and May 1956 in preparation for the concurrent exhibitions of his work at the Venice Biennale and at the Kunsthalle in Bern in June of that year.  According to recent scholarship by Véronique Wiesinger, six of the plasters were exhibited in Venice as ""works in progress"" (see fig. 1) and four were shown in Bern (see fig. 3).  Judging from photographs of these exhibitions, we can see that the plaster of the present sculpture was exhibited in Venice and titled collectively with the others, Six Figures.  Giacometti eventually selected nine of these plasters for casting into bronze in editions

Richly balanced, pure and absolute, Piero Manzoni’s elegant Achrome of 1961 presents an exemplary archetype of the artist’s desire to free the surface of painting by employing only the most primary of materials. Here Manzoni’s singular use of kaolin and cloth transcends the painterly gesture inherent to traditional post-war artistic production, refining the work to its most untouched, raw materiality. Indeed, Achrome is a testament to the artist’s own venerable words: “We absolutely cannot consider the picture as a space onto which to project our mental scenography. It is the area of freedom in which we search for the discovery of our first images. Images which are as

Maurice de Vlaminck lived and worked for the majority of his life in the towns south-east of Paris.  By 1900 he began walking along the banks of the Seine, painting the suburban towns of Chatou, Croissy, La Grenouillère and and Bougival.  The views of these towns are the genesis of the Fauve landscape in which he collaborated with his friend and fellow painter, André Derain.  Although he traveled throughout France to paint with the other Fauvists, Vlaminck always returned to the towns around the environs of Paris that had been earlier painted by Monet and Renoir.
By 1907 Vlaminck modified his bold Fauvist palette, and he described the transition as follows, ""To work by pressing the tube directly onto a canvas soon leads to excessive cleverness; in the end you transpose mathematically...  emerald green becomes black, pink a flamboyant red, etc.  Suddenly

Ridgefield, The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Mysterious and Magical Realism, April - August 1980, cat. no. 54
Mark Rothko is among the pantheon of artists whose ability to evoke universal truths through painting has fundamentally shifted our visual culture. Gifted by the artist to the Weisman family in a gesture of friendship and remaining in the family since then, Untitled (Nude) and Untitled (Underwater Series) embody two crucial stages in the artist’s creative growth, acting as pivotal exemplars in the development of Rothko’s voice in New York’s mid-century artistic firmament. Rothko met the late Jesse Weisman in the 1930s and the two became trusted friends, sharing summer rental houses in Mahopac, NY on their family vacations with their wives and children. As Jesse’s daughter, Susan Weisman McGee, recalls, “when my brother, Peter, was young and the Rothkos would come over to visit, Mark would sit Peter on his lap and draw pictures of cowboys and Indians.”

The sitter for the present portrait was originally identified by Venturi as the artist's younger sister Marie. There is only one other recorded portrait of Marie now in the collection of The Saint-Louis Art Museum, and while both paintings share a similar date of execution, pose and the palette-knife construction, their differences are still noteworthy: the present painting favours a darker palette, the figure subtly emerging from the deep black background, her eyes downcast. The overall mood is far more dramatic and romantic – presaging Van Gogh portraits of Dutch peasant women of the 1880s.
  John Rewald wrote about the present work: 'Venturi has identified the model as the artist's sister Marie, born in July 1841. This seems unlikely however when one compares this portrait with the photograph [fig. 1] dating from about 1870, or with no. 119 [fig. 2], which is documented

Studie für Herbstlandschaft mit Booten was executed in the autumn of 1908 at the beginning of Kandinsky’s journey to abstraction. This crucial period in the artist’s career was played out in the picturesque town of Murnau and the countryside surrounding it, which lay to the south of Munich. Kandinsky was accompanied by his fellow painters Gabriele Münter, Alexej von Jawlensky and Marianne von Werefkin with whom he had spent the summer painting and exchanging ideas. Murnau was only a short train ride from Munich, and the time Kandinsky spent there in the first half of 1908 had a profound effect on his artistic development. The natural beauty of the region and the great variety of sceneries, from towns, fields, mountains and lakes, were thoroughly explored by the artist and his friends. Hans K. Roethel and Jean K. Benjamin note in their entry on this work in

Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.
Basquiat’s burgeoning stardom reached a climax in 1982, the year after Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) was created. The artist spent 1982 jet-setting around the world, appearing at major exhibitions, as each

Within the transformative history of 20th century American painting, Clyfford Still was a unique maverick, incisively intelligent, utterly influential and intransigently bold. 1948-H exemplifies the formidable purpose with which Still approached painting, confident in his faith in art as a medium for expressing the inexpressible. In keeping with the heroic spirit of American art in the post-war years, Still’s artistic journey was grand in concept as he triumphantly arrived at a new type of abstract painting steeped in attitudes of power and ascendancy. 1948-H amply displays the innovative painterly style that Still brought from the West to New York City during the late 1940s, profoundly influencing his colleagues at this intensive time of creative ferment. Within the same all-over framework of New York’s Action Painting, Still’s compacted and robust forms press

Famille d’arlequin is a wonderful example of Picasso’s celebrated Rose period, which was dominated by images of family groups.  During this time, the artist was fascinated by harlequins, acrobats, actors and circus performers, and his depictions of these characters and their families culminated in the monumental La Famille de saltimbanques (see fig. 1).  These family groups are often accompanied by an animal, such as a monkey (see fig. 2) or a dog, and feature the harlequin wearing the characteristic lozenge pattern costume and hat.  The society outcasts such as circus performers had a particular resonance with the young Picasso, who saw in them a symbol of human suffering, particularly the suffering of the artist.  Whilst throughout his work most of his harlequins are depicted as lonely, melancholy figures, in the present work the prevailing mood is one

“Nothing can always be the subject of something. I mean, what’s nice about those paintings is you could do them every five years… anytime you wanted to, when you had the time…because there’s nothing to read into them… because even if the paints stayed the same, everything else – and everyone else – would have changed.”

Le Pont de bois was painted in 1872, the year that Monet created his famous L’Impression, soleil levant, now in the Musée Marmottan, Paris, the work included in the First Impressionist Exhibition in 1874 that gave the Impressionist movement its name. Here, we see similar brushwork and a deep interest in fleeting effects of colour and light. The reflections in the water that are such an important element of this composition fascinated Monet for the rest of his career, as evidenced by his crowning achievement, the Water Lilies in the Musée de l’Orangerie, Paris. Indeed, his gift for painting water was underscored by the French poet and critic Stéphane Mallarmé who noted in 1876 that ‘Monet loves water, and it is his especial gift to portray its mobility and transparency, be it sea or river, grey or monotonous, or coloured by the sky. I have never seen a boat poised

Willem de Kooning’s Untitled XVI dates from 1975, the year when the artist ended a long period of abstinence from painting and produced twenty large-scale canvases of explosive, vibrant color executed in lush, sensuous paint strokes, all in the space of only six months. Normally an artist who heavily scrutinized and reworked his canvases at great length, de Kooning marveled at his own burst of creativity, experiencing a great resurgence of confidence in his masterful manipulation of oil paint.  As de Kooning recalled in 1981, “I made those paintings one after the other, no trouble at all. I couldn’t miss. It’s a nice feeling. It’s strange. It’s like a man at a gambling table [who] feels that he can’t lose.  But when he walks away with all the dough, he knows he can’t do that again.  Because then it gets all self-conscious.  I wasn’t self-conscious.  I just

Danseuse rajustant sa sandale is a fine example of Degas' late pastels depicting a ballet dancer preparing for a performance. The artist's lifelong interest in dance developed in the 1860s, when as a young man he regularly attended the ballet and other performances such as opera, café-concerts and the circus. Degas was attracted to the spectacle and excitement of live entertainment and found in it an endless source of inspiration, sketching the performers from nature. In this manner he was able to study both the natural unguarded gestures of dancers at rest and the stylised movements of classical ballet. Degas was fascinated not only by the public spectacle of ballet performances, but also by the more informal situations around them: the behind-the-scenes world of the rehearsal room or the dance class, the dancers' preparation for and tension before a performance, and the more relaxed,

The present work was executed in 1969 when, at almost 90, Picasso’s own physical stamina had inevitably waned, yet his focus on erotic subjects in his paintings and drawings only intensified. Rendered with a confident and free-flowing line, this image of a reclining nude is one of pure sensuality and takes the odalisque paintings of Ingres and Matisse as clear references. The figure reclines languorously and her contortions evoke some of Picasso's most sensual depictions of the voluptuous Marie-Thérèse from the 1930s while also recalling the drama of his masterpieces like La Femme qui pleure with the figure’s gnarled fingers and contorted head. It is Picasso's innate ability to combine his dream-like, voluptuous imagery with the energetic confrontation of his strong line which makes Nu couché a master example of his late work.

Homme assis, is a remarkable example of Picasso's mature style; brimming with painterly verve and stylish invention. The artist's astonishing capacity for handling paint is wonderfully present in Homme assis. Lustrous passages of colour cover the whole canvas endowing the figure with a startlingly vivid presence. Throughout his œuvre, Picasso's images of the male figure embody masculine power, and are rendered with a bravuric intensity . 'I have less and less time and I have more and more to say' commented Picasso in his last decade (quoted in Klaus Gallwitz, Picasso Laureatus, Lausanne & Paris, 1971, p. 166), and the freedom and spontaneity of his mature work, together with the recourse to archetypal figures and symbols is visual evidence of this. The seemingly limitless energy that characterises do much of his work is extant in this final burst of creativity,

The vibrant Buste d’homme lauré is a powerful example of a theme that was central to Picasso in the last years of his life. The work was painted during Picasso’s most prolific year, 1969, during which he seemed to not at all be affected by his advanced age but rather invigorated that he had more and more to paint.  These works were exhibited in a dedicated show the following year in 1970, organized by Christian Zervos, which opened at the Palais des Papes in Avignon.  This exhibition was one of two major exhibitions devoted to this time in the artist’s career and was the only one held during his life time. The large canvases were displayed one on top of another in the hall of Clement IV, taking full advantage of the high-vaulted ceilings in the Gothic venue.
Picasso’s objective to paint ‘nature’ is in direct opposition to the abstraction and minimalism

This important depiction of the Breton countryside is one of the pictures that Gauguin completed in 1889, when he was working in Pont Aven.  Executed with lush colors and linear undulations that presage his pictures of the tropics, this composition presents an exoticized depiction of the region, interpreted through the stylization of Gauguin’s late Symbolist aesthetic. 
The romanticizing of the natural world in this picture is indicative of Gauguin's desire to escape the trappings of industrialized France in the months prior to his departure for the South Pacific.  Writing to Odilon Redon that September, Gauguin announced his plan: ""My mind is made up, and since I've been in Brittany I've altered my decision somewhat.  Even Madagascar is too near the civilized world; I shall go to Tahiti and I hope to end my days there... My art... is only a seedling

Essay No. 1:
Mather and Miller stated that wealthy New York Hicksite Quaker merchant Amos Willets commissioned this painting. He was related to the Hicks family through marriage. Correspondence with Mabel Willets Abendroth, Harrison, N.Y., in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art  Center archives also indicated that Amos Willets was the first owner. Documentation for ""commissioning"" the work from the artist is unknown, however. It is more likely that the painting was a gift for which Willets may voluntarily have sent money to Hicks.
This Kingdom was subsequently given to Amos's nephew Robert R. Willets, who married Edward Hicks's granddaughter Tacie Parry, daughter of Isaac C. and Sarah Hicks Parry. Robert and Tacie's daughter Mabel Willets Abendroth inherited the painting and gave it to her son William P. Abendroth

Brice Marden's trajectory as an artist encompasses a dramatic shift in his painterly vocabulary and defies critical concepts about the boundaries between seemingly contradictory schools of painterly expression. Striving toward a reinvention of style and a departure from critically acclaimed work can be a risk but it is a vital one for artists to retain a sense of vitality and discovery in their work. Few contemporary artists have navigated this journey with as much success as Marden. Cold Mountain I (Path) is the culmination of Marden's journey toward this new style of painting and a testament to his exploratory spirit. Titled for Han Shan, known as Cold Mountain, a legendary 8th or 9th century Chinese poet, the Cold Mountain series of six monumental canvases manifest the many threads of innovation leading away from Marden's monochromatic,

The amorous couple was a dominant theme during the final years of Picasso's life.  The present work, painted when the artist was 88, is a poignant manifestation of this subject.  The male figure, serenading his lover  as his limbs intertwine with hers, underscoring the physical melding of two bodies into one unified form.  As was the case for the artist's late compositions, the female figure is a reference to Picasso's wife Jacqueline, and the male figure to the artist himself.  Confronted by waning virility and his own mortality, Picasso approached the present work with a passion and tenderness that is evidenced in the tenderness shared between the two figures.
The theme of embracing lovers can be found as early as the artist's Blue and Rose Periods and recurs from that point in drastically differing manifestations,

Looking at this tranquil subject and the resonant palette of purple, green and pink, it is fascinating to consider that this composition dates from one of the most inventive and turbulent periods of Matisse's career.  Indeed, this lush depiction of a potted geranium was a truly avant-garde picture when Matisse painted it in 1910.   During this period, Matisse's bold use of color and loose brushwork - remnants of Fauvism - were taken to new extremes in sharp contrast to the monochrome tonality preferred by the Cubists.   Critics in Paris were stunned by his work, with one evening claiming at the end of 1910,  ""Matisse has done more harm in a year than an epidemic!  Matisse causes insanity!""   Even his fellow artists, egged on by their ringleader Picasso, actively

Written in Jean-Michel Basquiat’s unmistakeable scrawl, Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) explores the power of text in an artwork. For an artist who loved bebop and beat poetry, especially the writings of Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Basquiat relished the wordplay in the present work. The simplicity and elegance of the words themselves takes on a harmonious quality as the viewer reads through the enigmatic and highly stylised words of poetry on three otherwise blank pieces of notebook paper.
Basquiat’s burgeoning stardom reached a climax in 1982, the year after Untitled (Shadow in His Office); Untitled (Oil And Water…); Untitled (Negative So Slow For That Reason) was created. The artist spent 1982 jet-setting around the world, appearing at major exhibitions, as each

Of Classical Ladies

As it is imperative to make a draft when painting other human figures, so it is in the case of painting classical ladies. As a matter of fact, the draft should be made with greater care and, particularly in the elaborate style, should never be rough and offhand, for a little error in one single line may spoil the whole picture. When the willow-charcoal draft is completed and its outline marked out with diluted ink, the charcoal lines can be dusted off without leaving any trace at all.

Some boudoir themes are so difficult to interpret that the painter must exert his imagination over and over again and make no bones about striking out and correcting parts of his draft several times till it is unimpeachable, before using ink. The face of his subjects, as well as the clothes and ornaments, may be either dignified, radiant, ravishing, or graceful,

Inscription:
Carried by tiger and flew by phoenix, the deity is not yet far off;
The idle court is quiet and forlorn in the longish night.
Under the west tower shone on by the cool and hospitable moon,
I remember a phoenix’s warble in the thick clouds bringing to mind the music of her flute.
Painted by Dai-chien Jushi Chang Yuan at Dafeng Tang. It was autumn, the eighth lunar month of the yiwei year.

Kirchner's dynamic Gruppe Badender am Strand represents the apotheosis of his achievements as a leading member of the German Expressionist movement.  Kirchner's primary emphasis during this key period in his career was the naturalistic representation of the human form in its most primitive state, and this picture essentially defines that aesthetic goal. Painted in the summer of 1913, this was one of the last works that Kirchner completed around the time of the official dissolution of the artistic group known as Die Brücke, and therefore it marks the culmination of one of the most important avant-garde movements of the early 20th century. 

Since the group's inception in 1905, the painters associated with Die Brücke, including Kirchner, Heckel, Nolde and Schmidt-Rotluff, set out to render the human form in its natural

Rodin’s Le Penseur has become one of the most recognisable sculptures in the history of art. The work’s pertinence to Rodin's contemporaries was immediate and its continued relevance in today's visual culture has solidified the sculpture's legacy. Though he firmly grounded Le Penseur in intellectual history, Rodin transcended preceding imagery to create a true masterpiece that continues to transfix contemporary society. The Alexis Rudier foundry, known for having created some of the most desirable casts of Rodin's oeuvre, executed approximately 30 casts of Le Penseur in this scale beginning in 1902. Other casts from this edition hold positions in prominent museums including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; National Gallery of Art, Washintgon, D.C.; The Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University; the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia;

Moskau II, painted in 1916, is one of the finest canvases from Kandinsky’s Russian period in private hands. The tumultuous events that led Kandinsky back to his birthplace precipitated a revival of the artist’s deep-seated love of the city of his birth, Moscow. This kaleidoscopic composition, with its dazzling energy and rich colouration, depicts the city as a place of dynamic beauty, as spiritually enriching as the mountains of Murnau which had informed his development of abstraction in the first years of the twentieth century. In 1916 and 1917 Kandinsky executed a few paintings which took their inspiration from the city, and included clear references to the architectural styles for which Moscow is known (figs. 2 & 4).  Kandinsky’s passion for Moscow is made clear in the letters he wrote: ‘The sun melts all of Moscow down to a single spot that, like a mad tuba, starts all

Herbstlandschaft, painted in 1911, is a powerful and eloquent expression of the artist’s quest for abstraction. The composition achieves an exquisite balance between colours and forms, displaying a joyous assembly of golden yellow, verdant green and rich purple and blue tones applied in sweeping forms and fluid brushstrokes. This ground-breaking work represents Kandinsky’s achievement of the almost totally abstract idiom which he conceived in 1909-1911 alongside the completion of his text On the Spiritual in Art. The composition for the present work was the subject of an earlier study completed in the autumn of 1910 (fig. 1), and which he would continue to explore over the next few years (fig. 2). Works from this crucial period still have specific figurative elements which possessed symbolic qualities for the artist, such as the folkloric representation of a lake with
